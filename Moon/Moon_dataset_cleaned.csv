Janne S,1,2025-05-10 02:00:00,"First of all, we ordered aperitifs but received the first course before these drinks. We asked for our dishes to be returned and for aperitifs to be brought to the table. This was done, but the dishes were brought back before we had even had time to taste our aperitifs. Plus, the Negroni I ordered was practically just Campari. And my daughter's drinking glass was dirty.

After this, my friend did not receive the wine he ordered. And what is most incomprehensible, the staff did not bring the next course on the menu to the table because there was still wine from the previous course in the glass.

The food was decent, but the staff was inexperienced, although helpful. They should learn the basics.",English,-1.0,negative
bergertime2017,4,2025-05-07 02:00:00,"I doubt, average or good.. Let me do well because there is certainly potential Anyway first the pluses. We had a 4-course menu of €70 pp. Personally, we thought a dish tasted less but still almost a number 8. Views are fabulous, of course. It takes you an hour to go all the way around. Service was okay, friendly but not really what you expected. Say a seven plus. What is not nice are the chairs that we have secretly exchanged with another table. They were a lot better. And then the toilet ... rancid ordinary (both ladies and gentlemen toilet). In my eyes, you can't make this if you want to have a certain look. I think a little more attention to decor, hygiene and customer approach can really be a nice restaurant without effort.",English,0.0,neutral
MP-91,5,2025-05-06 02:00:00,"Truly unique dining experience, a must-try in Amsterdam - food and wine were delicious and the view was unreal, would recommend for a special meal",English,1.0,positive
Canberk D,2,,"We had high expectations for our dinner at Moon, especially since it was meant to be a special celebration – our anniversary.

Before our visit, I sent an email to inform the restaurant that it was a meaningful evening for us.
Unfortunately, we received no acknowledgment or reply whatsoever. Reaching the restaurant was extremely difficult, even when we tried multiple times to adjust our reservation time. Eventually, our hotel’s concierge managed to help us shift our reservation by one hour, for which we were grateful.

Upon arrival, the ambience and view were stunning – truly impressive.
However, that’s where the positives end.

The experience fell apart in terms of service and food:

The menu offered no à la carte options, only a very limited selection of starters and a fixed menu.

The seafood-focused starters were undercooked and not enjoyable.

The main course featured a meat option that was difficult to eat, especially for someone who doesn't normally enjoy red meat.

My partner couldn’t eat most of the meal and was left hungry by the end of the night.

What was most disappointing was the complete lack of attention from the staff:

No one checked in on us after we left full plates untouched.

Not a single staff member asked, “Is everything alright?” or offered an alternative.

We had to pour our own wine and water — the staff was indifferent and unavailable.

Even when they saw untouched plates, they simply cleared them without comment.

In the end, we paid for two full fixed menus and wine, without having actually been able to enjoy the meal.
We left quietly and disappointed, feeling like the restaurant completely missed the chance to deliver a memorable experience, despite its beautiful setting.

Moon has so much potential, but it’s being wasted by inattentive service and poorly executed food.
Unfortunately, I wouldn’t recommend this restaurant for special occasions — or at all — until serious improvements are made in hospitality and menu flexibility.",English,-0.5,negative
Chipou06,5,,"We had lunch and it was also a beautiful sun that day 
The restaurant pivots and we enjoy an extraordinary view we never have the same throughout our meal 
We had lunch in 4 courses at 70€ the dishes were fine and well presented
We were delighted with this experience",English,1.0,positive
Marie,3,,"We spent a very pleasant time at Moon restaurant. The experience is truly original: the view is beautiful and the fact that the restaurant pivots allows you to enjoy a different panorama throughout the meal, which is quite unique.

The cuisine was excellent, with appreciable vegetarian options, and overall we feasted.

However, big downside: a kind of club is just below, and the noise – very present – clearly hindered the tranquility of our dinner. The bass echoed throughout the meal, and the view of the club terrace, where groups were celebrating, broke the intimate atmosphere we had hoped for.

The service was generally friendly, but a little slow at times (for example, a glass of wine arrived after the finished dish). Nothing dramatic, but it deserves to be a little better tuned.

In summary, a beautiful address for the view and the kitchen, but the sound environment is to be taken into account",English,0.0,neutral
coyfanatic,3,,"We visited for dinner on our last night in Amsterdam. The experience, the view, the novelty of a rotating restaurant - all wonderful! We love a fixed course menu and appreciated the surprises that this one brought. Overall, the food was good, the wine we had along with the food was also good. My one concern with the whole evening was the service. We waited a bit between courses, and for drinks. We then waited 20 minutes for the bill once we asked for it, even having to ask someone else to bring it.",English,0.5,positive
Lucy M,3,2025-05-01 02:00:00,"View was nice, certainly an experience and offers picturesque views if you’re into that. Can’t say we were too impressed with the food or service though; food was okay and service wasn’t awful but there was just nothing special to it and no personal touches or an attempt to build rapport.

We booked and stated it was a Birthday celebration, zero acknowledgment and then as well when we were ordering our tasting menu nobody queried dietary requirements or allergens. We’d clearly stated on the booking that one of us was pescatarian, yet had to inform of this as nobody was aware. What’s the point in asking upon booking if it isn’t acknowledged when we arrive?",English,-0.5,negative
Amy E C,4,,"Underwhelmed and disappointed with our dinner but the view was wonderful! I had read a lot about Moon and even our Amsterdam City Food tour guide recommended it so I was really excited to go!  Unfortunately we hit an off night with the menu, the seasonal selections or something because our courses were mostly underwhelming and not as tasty or delicious as I had expected/hoped they would be. I feel like I am a good judge of food becasue I eat almost everything and every cuisine type and have a very good sense of smell and palate and the foods, to me, simply lacked a complex flavor profile. Every dish needed some oomph-textures, seasonings, heat, acid, salt...and the progression of dishes lacked a theme for me unless beets and pumpkin were it (that seems like an autumn menu!). To be fair, our last course before dessert was duck which to most was probably very good but it was not to us-a touch overcooked and texture was off and skin not cripsy.  We were grateful the dessert was good becasue we were losing a bit of faith. We did enjoy the views and really loved the feel of the space-it was wonderful looking out! As mentioned this may have been an off night for us so I would still recommend going becasue the overall experience was nice to have for a first time in Amsterdam. Maybe lunch would have been a better choice!",English,0.0,neutral

LGA63,5,,"The Moon experience begins in the heights but does not stay there. 
As the location of the restaurant is so overwhelming, supplemented by a smooth rotation with a 360° view of the city, there might be the temptation to invest less in the kitchen. 
And that wasn't the case. The menu, where vegetarian dishes predominate, is very well achieved in presentation, quality and taste, which makes a visit to this restaurant something truly unique, both during the day (our option) and surely at night.",English,1.0,positive
Carlo L,2,,"Moon Restaurant undoubtedly impresses with its spectacular views over Amsterdam. The rotating platform creates a unique ambience, and the food was also presented tastefully and creatively.

Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. Although the menu was brought to us, we were not asked for an aperitif or an appetizer. We were also not offered the wine accompaniment to the menu – an absolute no-go in a restaurant of this price range. The staff was friendly but overall too reserved and not attentive.

For a restaurant with this aspiration, I expect a professional service that actively accompanies guests through the evening. So it unfortunately stayed with a great view and good food, but without the special experience you would hope for here.",English,-0.5,negative

Edwin V,1,,"In one word worthless!

Moon pretends to be a Fine Dining restaurant with videos on social media and on their own website... What gastronomy? Best people don't fall for it. The view of A’dam is beautiful, but that’s really all.

The reception both downstairs and upstairs and service are impersonal and rushed.
No care and attention for the customer and comparable to a tourist attraction.
The kitchen brigade does nothing more than Martinair Partyservice or Maison van den Boer Catering used to do. Everything is portioned, a child can do laundry!

The quality is poor. The starter too cold and the main courses lukewarm.
A 6 course chef’s menu overpriced for € 99.00. Well, you'd better go elsewhere for that.

What was a special occasion for us was a downer first class.

When me and my girlfriend found a dish far too salty and announced that the waiter responded that he had tasted it himself and that we were wrong. Nothing else was done with it..  145 euros for 5 courses, 65 euros pp for wine pairing. So the total bill was 420 euros. It's a shame.

The 1st course was a fish fillet in tomato sauce and zucchini that tasted just like sardines in tomato sauce. For the main course, we got the sirloin which looked pink and soft but it was hard to cut and hard to chew. The service is slow too, every dish arrived with 20 min of difference;  by the time the dessert was served, we were there for 1.5 hours. The dessert was good but the ice cream was hard, a little bit icy in the middle. So, overall experience is Ok because of the nature of the restaurant, but I believe they can do a better job with the food.",English,0.0,neutral

This outstanding establishment can easily rate as top of class for its views, tasteful decor, impeccable cleanliness, personable and knowledgeable staff,  imaginative and complimentary set menu with excellent pairing choices.  If you need to feel in absolute control of your dining experience, perhaps an alternative venue might be a better choice.  If you are willing to let others carry you to culinary heaven then book a table and let this team elevate your taste buds to new highs!

antonello1970gemelli,3,,"Restaurant on the 19th floor of the A'DAM tower (remember to go to the reception and give the name of the reservation, you cannot directly go to the elevators). Fantastic 360 degree view of the city (the platform rotates slowly) and of the open kitchen during rotation. Friendly and qualified staff. I attach photos of the menu (in Dutch and English) and the dishes taken. It is not possible to see from the site which dishes you will eat (also because it varies depending on the season) but it is possible to request information (also for possible allergies) via email. The reservation requires a deposit (€40) and it is important to follow the provisions and times that are described in the emails received if we wish to cancel without losing the deposit (the emails are ALWAYS sent, check your spam). The menu includes 2 options: 5 dishes for €83 or 6 dishes for €99 (the cheeses are priced separately at €18 as are the oysters and other tastings). Not cheap wine list. The raw materials are good, some doubts about the combinations and the use of spices which can be a little difficult on the palate. We took the option of 5 dishes (see photo) and 2 bottles of San Pellegrino water. Cost €176 (including €40 deposit).

KrazyKatlover,5,2024-05-22 02:00:00,"OMG……this place is AWESOME! I booked here for my 50th birthday lunch and as we were already in Adam Tower visiting its sights, it was a no brainer but to finish off the experience in this beautiful revolving restaurant viewing the whole of Amsterdam with fine dining to boot. 
I’m so glad I decided to come here, the staff greeted us and explained in great detail how the menu worked and what exactly was in each course. They were all so friendly, cheerful and knowledgeable. Our table was completely stunning, linen napkins and the most polished cutlery and glassware, and the views were outstanding……I think we rotated twice during our lunch visit but we didn’t exactly rush and this is what I like about this place, they let you take in and  enjoy the calming ambience without feeling you are hurried out. 
We had the four course taster menu with wine of course, and each one was presented like a work of art. The flavours of each dish was a culinary explosion in your mouth with adventurous pairings and all of it worked! It was so nice to see the open kitchen with all the chefs hard at work putting these dishes together, in fact, because it was so exposed, it felt reassuring…..they had nothing to hide, except expose pure beautiful food being cooked and beautifully presented with some very talented chefs. 
Each dish was so different and despite small plates, it was unbelievably filling by the end of it all. 
The waitress even came over at the end and presented me with birthday sweet treats to finish  which was a superb touch to a truly special meal out. 
There is not one thing I can say was bad about this place. The service was exceptional, they all went above and beyond, the price of what we paid was outstanding, the views and ambience was just perfect, it was impeccably clean, tidy and well presented, the food was a taste sensation and I would visit here again in a heartbeat. Now I’ve seen what it is like during the day……maybe an evening visit would be next on the menu!

Heidi W,1,,"All other negative reviews of this place are pretty accurate. I still chose to come here to experience for myself of how bad it could be. I was staying at the Sir Adam Hotel and didn’t want to go back to the city to scavenge for food. Well, dare I say big regrets.

1) Slow Service: The service was, indeed, very slow. During switching of plates, I found myself resting my chin on my hand, as I kept waiting and waiting. It’s not like these servers were all occupied either? Some of them were seen leisurely strolling around the restaurant. So I’m genuinely unsure what drove this slow service unless the kitchen needs big time help in general. 

2) Strange Combination of Tastes / Ingredients: Cumin and BBQ were one of the many strange combos that I didn’t think belong together. I’m no stranger to the fine dining space in NYC, not to sound snooty. I’m happy to pay good money for a decent meal but this was clearly not it. Honestly, this restaurant reminds me of a pseudo Michelin establishment after some chef decided to open a restaurant from watching a few episodes of Top Chef, Kitchen Confidential, or some cook show. 

3) Outdated Reservation System: On top of having to book a reservation using a system that looked like it came from the 90s, I don’t think staff members are very knowledgable of how it all comes together. On the ground floor, a staff member named Bryan told me that I needed a reservation to go up. I made a reservation on the spot for a future time. Fast forward to actually heading up to the restaurant, Bryan told me that he couldn’t find my reservation. At that point, I had already waited 45 minutes and rightfully so, I was frustrated because it was already kinda late into the evening. Had I known that their reservation sucked this badly, I wouldn’t be making the reservation at all. He figured it all out at the end and sent me up to the restaurant. Needless to say, I really wish the staff members would take their time to understand their customers before spewing out random things. Active listening is important no matter which country you’re from, y’all.",English,-1.0,negative

Food was delicious (but very expensive for what you get in terms of portion size, similar to taster menu) though but a few options wouldn’t go a miss in case you didn’t like a particular course. Long wait (over half hour) after we had finished to ask for the bill. Lift to restaurant has awful changing colour lighting. I can’t explain it but it is not good on the eye and actually makes you feel sick.",English,-0.5,negative

kaandSam,5,,"Wow, loved every second, this revolving restaurant is beautiful, my partner and I came to Amsterdam for my 55th birthday, he booked the Moon restaurant and I was totally in my element. It was truly amazing. The service was fabulous, we had the 5 course menu and my partner is vegetarian, every course was delicious. The view is amazing and there are booths for seating which I love. The music was exceptional and have downloaded the tracks onto my spotify list just for the fab memories.  We were really looked after and would love to return. The service was so lovely and wanted to mention to Quincy and Jesper they really looked after us and are a credit to the Moon restaurant, we wish them well.",English,1.0,positive

Lynn M,2,,"Darn it… I should have listened to the other reviews.  As a frequent reviewer myself, I usually do but, wanted to experience the view of Amsterdam up high.  Bottom line the food is not great.   It was like child’s play, putting a lot of flavors together with art work to make a meal.  As a result, most was  wayyyy too salty, and included flavors that just didn’t jive.  I’ve been to many fine dining restaurants with and without tasting menus…this one doesn’t cut it at all.  The service is slack, slack, slack.  Servers never refill drinks, or come by to see if you need anything.   3 courses took almost 3 hours and 2 more courses left to go!  
The views were fine but you’ll appreciate Amsterdam just as well if you explore on your own or with other tours.  

Lastly, the restaurant needs some love, updating.",English,-0.5,negative

Courtney E,2,,"This was our fourth visit to Moon, as we stay at Sir Adam every year and visit on our final night to end our holiday. Previously it was always a good experience however this time felt like the restaurant had gone downhill, losing the attention to detail and passion it previously had.

Firstly the service was poor, with disregard for the basics you’d expect for a high price meal i.e. empty plates sat for longer than they should, no topping up of empty glasses and minimal explanation of the menu. Then the food felt a lot lower quality than our previous visits. There were a couple nice dishes but the main the duck was chewy and difficult to eat. Then there was the issue with the dessert, where my partner took a sharp bite and pulled out of his mouth the end of a toothpick. 

We were informed by the waiter when making the desset they use the toothpicks to hold it together and it must have got stuck inside. There was no real concern or genuine apology which made the whole situation worse. The only compensation the waiter offered us a free coffee on behalf of the kitchen. While it is understandable to some extent that these issues can happen, the fact no manager came to apologise and they only offered a coffee sums up the lack of customer service and little regard for holding high standards in what they are serving customers. We left the restaurant having paid €200 for a very disappointing meal, and my partner a cut mouth. We will not be returning for a fifth time, which is a real shame for somewhere we used to love. 

If you are wanting a meal with a nice view it is worth checking out once, but if you are expecting any more for your money than a view I would recommend trying somewhere else.",English,-0.5,negative
Sara,3,,"The Moon Restaurant is something special.
We really enjoyed the evening there.
We really enjoyed the various courses from the kitchen. A big compliment goes to the inquiry and adjustment of the courses regarding intolerances.

This behavior is unacceptable in this price range.

We constantly had to ask for drinks, and get up and find our server, which was difficult as the floor is moving. The restrooms were under construction on that floor, so we had to go upstairs and use the public bathrooms for the upper floors of the building which were not clean and smelled horrible.

It's just not neat.,English,-1.0,negative
Foodie1717,4,,"The views in Moon in the A’Dam Tower in Amsterdam are spectacular. The restaurant is located on the 19th floor and slightly rotates (slowly, don’t worry you don’t feel like you’re going fast). This enables you to see all different areas of Amsterdam and the water (but not the main downtown since it’s across from Centraal Canal, which is a 15-minute walk from the main downtown, Dam Square, where the Royal Palace and the National Monument are.

The food was not very good. If the food was better, I’d be sure to be back every time I came to Amsterdam but now I’m not sure. Moon and the A’Dam Tower are out of the way across the water from the main downtown, so I don’t think it’s worth the trip. 

The meal is set up in a 4-course menu for 70 Euros per person:
-Complimentary Starter: very tasty bread & butter 
-1st Course: I ordered the Kohlrabi and my husband ordered the Mackerel. The Kohlrabi was gross. The Mackeral was decent
-2nd Course: I ordered the Scallop and my husband ordered the Gnocchi. The scallop was OK- it had some sort of green sauce on top that wasn’t good. My husband’s gnocchi tasted more like a Pierogi (crispy outside). I thought it was decent but my husband didn’t like it
-3rd Course (Entree): I ordered the Short Rib and my husband ordered the Chicory. We both liked the Short Rib
-4th Course (Dessert): Dame Blanche (basically a hazelnut chocolate and coconut circle with chocolate drizzle on top and whipped cream). This was the best part of the whole meal (besides the bread and butter that was also very good)

I really like restaurants with good food and preferred The Seafood Bar (Van Baerlestraat 5h, 1071 AL, Amsterdam). It is located closeby to the Van Goh Museum.

If you’re already going on the A’Dam Tower swing, then I’d recommend Moon. Madam restaurant is a floor higher but more casual foods such as burgers and doesn’t have a rotating view of the city (but you can still see the city and are on the water). I haven’t eaten at Madam though.",English,0.5,positive

soskamama,1,,"A resturant with great views but very limited menu. You go for the experience but not really WOW. You can have the view on the roof for a small ticket and there is a cafe as well. For Fraction of the price!! Food tasted ok however nicely presented. 
Our experience was a disaster as we ended up overpaying due to be given the wrong bill. When we went back , we were denied a refund. Apparently staff had to get the restaurant’s finance dept to deal with it. They never did. The waiter refused even to apologise for their mistake saying we are forcing him to do so!!! Waiter was not helpful and had no customer services skill and a bit on the rude side. It’s been more than two weeks and we never heard back from them. And we still NEVER received an APOLOGY.
My advice is if you decide to go, be prepared for overpriced meal and possibility of being overcharged by paying for someone else’s meals instead. As it was our first day of the holiday, we kept feeling that we are being scammed one way or another.",English,-1.0,negative
Marcel Borst,1,,"This poor assessment is due to management choices. I have made a reservation for 2 people and want to add 2 more friends. One of them has recently had major stomach surgery and can therefore only consume 1 course. So we ask if it is possible that he only takes one course. Or that he gets an extra plate so he can eat off our plate. Or that Moon just shows some flexibility out of leniency and ensures that he too can enjoy a pleasant night out. The answer is hard and cold: ""No, we really can't do that.""

Our reservation is therefore immediately cancelled. For now and for the future. I thought restaurants are part of ""hospitality."" Which stands for Welcoming. That you'll do anything to make sure the customer is king. But at Moon they would rather see 3 guests leave, than make a little effort for a 4th.",English,-1.0,negative

There is also no correct information on the website, understandable to everyone. We asked the waitress to bring two bottles of Coca-Cola and a bottle of water for the remaining money, but she brought Coca-Cola in glasses and an open bottle of water.

Inspire16184358203,2,,"Pluspunten:
- Het restaurant heeft een fantastisch uitzicht. Je draait langzaam rond tijdens het eten. 

Minpunten:
- Voor dat uitzicht betaal je de hoofdprijs. 
Voor het diner betaal je €70 p.p.
- Het eten was voor dat bedrag vér onder de maat. Het was weinig, lauw/koud en smaakloos. Veel smaak hetzelfde. Weinig variatie. Voor patat erbij moet je extra betalen €7. Onbegrijpelijk!
- De patat was lauw/koud en véél te hard gebakken. Het leek wel voor de tweede keer gebakken te zijn. Na een opmerking hierover tegen de bediening dat de patat te hard was, werd daar niets mee gedaan. Een gemiste kans!
- De bediening sprak vaak engels. 
Ze draaiden hun deuntje af wat voor ""speciaal"" eten je wel niet op je bord had liggen. Ze spraken snel en ongeïnteresseerd. Niet te verstaan. 
- De bediening maakt bovendien onderscheid tussen klanten. Als ze merken dat ze wat rijkere klanten voor zich hebben veranderen ze hun houding. Voor deze mensen schenken ze o.a. uit de fles zelfs hun glas water ook bij! Deze klanten betalen hetzelfde als de andere gasten!
- De wc's zijn niet schoon. Moet niet kunnen voor zo'n restaurant.

We kregen 20 min voor sluit de rekening ongevraagd op onze tafel en die moesten we per direct afrekenen. Er zat ook een type bij in de bediening met de meest quasi nonchalante/onbeschofte houding die gewoon de borden op tafel knalde en nul gastvrijheidsgevoel had.

Service was also quite friendly. But I think the food did not worth the amount of money we paid. We took 5 courses dinner, two starters were weird in taste with undercooked chewy vegetables. Main dish was good and we liked the dessert as well.
For 100 euros per person there’re so many more better restaurants in Amsterdam with amazing food. In addition bathroom is very dirty, it’s not an expensive restaurant level, toilet at Amsterdam Centraal is cleaner. Please, hire a cleaner this is just embarrassing…

Marco Parent,1,,"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but after our visit on March 3rd, I feel compelled to share just how profoundly disappointing our experience was. Based on the image you present online, we expected a refined and memorable evening. Instead, we encountered inattentive service, subpar cuisine, and an overall indifference that made us question how this establishment has earned any accolades at all.

To say the service was lacking would be an understatement. We spent most of the evening trying to get the attention of anyone who might take the time to pour a glass of water or wine. When that failed, we resorted to opening our own bottles. Our assigned waiter seemed utterly disinterested—if not outright inconvenienced—by our presence, making it clear he had no desire to be there. Frankly, the level of neglect was baffling.

Then came the food, which was equally underwhelming. The ingredients were of noticeably low quality, and nothing about the dishes reflected the sophistication one would expect from a restaurant with a Gault & Millau recommendation. For a 99-euro tasting menu, we anticipated something at least remotely inspired, yet every plate was forgettable at best.

In short, this was not just a disappointing meal—it was a complete failure in both service and execution. I strongly suggest you reconsider the standards you claim to uphold because, based on our experience, they are nowhere to be found.",English,-1.0,negative

It is trying to be fine-dining but it falls quite a bit short. The experience was largely positive until the very end, with a nice ambience and the majority of servers welcoming, friendly and nice.

The dessert was brought out while we were in mid-conversation. A few of us were still finishing when the explanation was being given on dessert, so when one of our table said ""Sorry, excuse me - could you tell me again what dessert was?"" - only to be  very rudely 'reminded' that ""If you were not talking you'd have heard""......

I know when writing this down, it sounds like were were somewhat dismissive of them but actually, they just proceeded to tell some of the table what dessert was when some were in mid-conversation. It wasn't a moment where they said ""excuse me, I'd like to explain what dessert is"" etc.... with the room ambience quite loud, this was not us being disrespectful however, we were all utterly shocked at the response from the server.

I wasn't entirely sold on the pairing with the food, but they were very nice teas, although refills were sorely lacking. The view over Amsterdam  as you rotate around the top of the tower is very nice, the first one or two rotations.

However, the service as abysmal, and the wait time excruciating. Wait times between courses was easily 30 minutes each time. The wait staff made no attempts to clear our table when we were done, nor did they offer refills on our drinks or pay us any attention at all between courses. We repeatedly asked for things to be sped up, to no avail. Not even an apology, just a nod as they walked away. Only as we paid the bill, four hours after arriving, did they acknowledge the problem, and they knocked the desert off our bill in ""compensation"". Other tables around us were in the same situation. Had we known about the long waits ahead of us we would probably have left after the first two disappointing bland dishes. This restaurant is not worth your time.",English,-1.0,negative

Janna Carter,1,,"Don’t bother.

The menu says (for drinks) “because you should have choices” but what about the food? Even a Michelin Star restaurant gives you the choice between a couple of 5 or 6 course meals (that are posted ahead of time on the website). This was a set, SURPRISE menu that included an item on my allergy list. They did adjust the course, but that is something that should be asked at the time of reservation. The entire menu was not my ”choice”. While the potato pancakes were nice, the deer meat was tough and the cauliflower was closer to raw than cooked. Marinated raw fish is something I could have passed on. The bizarre combination of ingredients in each course was akin to throwing noodles at the wall to see what sticks. The hodge podge approach was an epic fail.

The view is spectacular. I like the idea of a rotating floor (in theory), but it’s an annoyance when you get motion sickness because you table faces out and you’re on the 5th rotation over the course of MORE THAN 3 HOURS. All seating should be perpendicular to the windows, not parallel. That way you don’t get sick from the constant reminder of motion. Add to that, NO RESTAURANT SHOULD HOLD YOU CAPTIVE FOR 3+ HOURS!

Bottom line: biggest waste of money for our entire 3-week trip to London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Munich and Vienna. This restaurant is an absolute blemish on a magnificent city.",English,-1.0,negative

Paolè Dominguez,2,,"We went here after visiting the top-floor view with fairly high expectations. After trying to book on the website, which has no translations into other languages, we managed to book with the help of Google Translate and among a thousand Christmas booking banners. The dinner was disappointing, considering the price for the sophisticated location. The dishes were decidedly inadequate for the presentation of the place; I expected more. My only praise went to the dish that stood out: the scallop. The butter was decidedly too salty. Be careful when asking for more bread, as the waiters are a bit reluctant to give it to you. They almost make you feel ashamed, even though you are given a piece of delicious bread each. Unfortunately, some people don't get enough, but I think it's acceptable for the price to give a little more upon request. The dessert was inedible, with a biscuit that looked like a stone. At the end of the dinner, every spoon in the room was clattering in an attempt to eat dessert. We were asked three times by three different waiters if we wanted anything more than water, almost annoying. When it came to the bill, the numbers didn't add up. I was perplexed and had to point out that we'd already paid the deposit for dinner online, even though we didn't mind paying a few euros more if it was worth it, so without realizing it, we'd have paid even more. For a seven-course tasting menu, we sat for three and a half hours. For €250 and the restaurant's appearance, I expected a more in-depth exploration of flavors. It's definitely an experience worth having, but it's not worth the price.",Italian,-0.5,negative

Kristoffer Myran Winsnes,5,,"What a place and what absolutely lovely food! There were 9 of us who had run the Amsterdam Marathon together who had dinner together at this great restaurant. And when it comes to the food, it exceeded my expectations. It was simply incredibly tasty, and food doesn't have to be the same day that has run so far. It's hard to put into words how delicious the experience was, but I'm pretty sure I'll remember this meal for a long, long time to come. We chose the 6 course menu and the portions were generous to be so stylish. Beautifully decorated and beautifully presented. Balanced and creative. The venue itself is also an attraction. You sit comfortably and absolutely see the whole city pass by because the entire restaurant rotates while you eat. We managed about three laps around and got a good look down on the center of Amsterdam and up the river. A superb setting for great food and good drink. We were there at the same time as ADE, a big dance festival, and because of that there was quite a lot of noise in the restaurant. Simply loud music. I don't know if this is everyday, but I doubt it. It didn't affect the experience of the food itself, but it clearly colored our overall experience a bit. At the same time, it seemed like it was a bit busy for the employees this day, because we had to ask for drink refills ourselves along the way. And then we informed them that they could bring the dishes a little faster, partly because it took a little long, but perhaps mostly because we were very hungry. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant, and even hope for a return visit when there is no dance festival in Amsterdam.",Norwegian,1.0,positive

The views are nice and it is a gimmick to be turned around the whole building, but that doesn't make a good restaurant.

Whenever you serve a glass of wine for 9-20 euro, you at least expect some sommelier to explain the journey that you will go through in combination with the food. It ended with, this wine comes from this year and this year was a good year for this wine....

Service: when you ask for a matched wine with every course, don't make me ask for it after the third course while having none before.

Unfortunately, we had to wait about 50 minutes after ordering for our first drink and first course. The food was very tasty and beautifully presented. The snacks beforehand are also highly recommended. Later on, I was only given tea instead of the wine accompaniment, which was resolved with a bit of back and forth. The wine selection was very good and complementary. The cheese selection at the end was also very tasty. The ambiance was nice, with a great view and otherwise friendly staff, but in our opinion, there were too few of them. It was a bit hectic/noisy.

Firstly, in terms of the quality and quantity of the dishes they were enjoyable, but sometimes the portions were a little imbalanced in terms of proteins and carbs. Also, the bread was a little dry and bland.

Secondly, we were a little disappointed in the service. While they told us that we should take it slow to enjoy the views, between the entree and the main we had to wait for more than an hour. When I went up to them, they said they will bring them ASAP but showed up with our desserts instead. I told them they had forgotten our mains and they did not make the effort to bring them and prepare the dessert afterwards but rather charged us for a three instead of four course menu. It would have been appropriate to charge less than that since all other dishes are significantly smaller than the main and I think a better solution due to the loss of time we experienced and the unsatisfactory lunch could have been found.",English,0.0,neutral

The revolving floor made us dizzy in the beginning but you eventually get used to it. The windows though definitely can use some cleaning services since the views are actually the only thing that is worth it in the end.
About the food, we went for the 5 course menu. The food looks good presentation-wise but the flavours are very flat and rather uninteresting unfortunately. Top highlight how bad was the rhubarb dessert.. Only one of 5 courses was actually worth it, the lamb. But even for that we were not asked how we would like it cooked and among the two of us one was cooked rare and the other medium/well. The bread was also served cold and felt like it was not even fresh or of high quality.

linc campbell,4,,"Atmosphere: The view is stunning. We are here in July and had the 8pm seating which was perfect to watch the city go from day to night in the rotating dining room.

Food: the amuse bouche of a seaweed salad with radish was phenomenal. A slightly sweet dressing that countered the brininess of the seaweed. The second course was yellowtail with asparagus and leeks, also quite good. The second course, beets with quinoa served slightly warm wasn’t for me, but others liked it. The third, a scallop with fregola in a butter froth was perfect. I could have had nothing but it all night long. The remaining dishes, herring, lamb, and the desert all underwhelmed. I generally don’t enjoy lamb, and it was true here. All others loved it. I would have enjoyed the desert if the rhubarb was cooked a bit more but it was quite stringy.

Service: friendly but slow, even for Europe. However, it did allow us to spend the three hours we did watching the day turn in to night above Amsterdam.

Hey Yo,1,2025-05-21 22:09:00,"We dined at this restaurant at 7:30 PM and ordered the set menu, but it took over an hour without anyone checking on us. Only after I approached a staff member did they realize they had completely forgotten to place our order. Although the waiter apologized — which I appreciated — the problems didn’t stop there.

We were a party of two, and I had clearly informed the staff when ordering that one of us does not eat beef and requested fish as a replacement. After waiting until 9:50 PM, the main course finally arrived — and unbelievably, they served us two beef dishes.

By then, it was dark outside, we were exhausted, and they told us we’d have to wait even longer for the corrected dish. The pacing of the meal was extremely slow overall, and there was no sense of presentation or ceremony. For example, the main course was simply a large piece of beef carved up and shared among many guests — not individually plated or thoughtfully prepared, as one would expect from a €70 tasting menu.

To make matters worse, the food was just average — in fact, we had better meals at several other restaurants nearby, for lower prices and with far better service. What was supposed to be a memorable dinner turned into a frustrating evening.

I had to wave the server down to get a glass of wine because they never asked if I wanted anything else to drink. I alternated between the water and wine throughout the meal. That worked well.

Tiphaine Ambry,3,,"It was my third time at Moon. I’m usually very happy with the food and the service, but this time it fell a bit short.
First of all, the menu was misleading - one of the starters was saying just “Mackerel”. It turned out to be raw (like tartare/sashimi). I wished that would have been spelled out either on the menu, or by the waitress when ordering.
Service was a bit hectic even though the restaurant wasn’t full. The waitress got distracted while pouring the sauce on my plate for the main course, and just stopped after a few drops - it was clear from seeing the other plates (full of sauce) that that was not the intended amount.
We asked 3x for extra bread before getting it.
The amount of food between two plates varied greatly. For the first main dish, gnocchis, which was absolutely delicious, my sister’s plate had 3 (!) gnocchis. Mine had 5, and the plate on the table next to us looked like a little mountain.

Speaking of the table next to us, they split a 4 persons table to seat us, so we were VERY close to our neighbors. Again, that didn’t feel necessary as the restaurant didn’t seem full to me.

Other than that I love the setting and the view, and it was wonderful to be there for the SAIL event, but for a rather expensive, paid in advance lunch menu, I was hoping for better.",English,0.0,neutral
Marga Lamas,4,,"A delightful experience in a refined setting.
The location is charming, the cuisine consistently excellent, and the service attentive and professional. One thoughtful suggestion: consider offering tap water as a courtesy upon seating.

If you’re looking for a place to relax for a few hours away from your busy life—this is a must-visit.

✨ Atmosphere: The music was absolutely amazing—5 stars. The smooth rotation speed of the restaurant felt elegant and unique—5 stars. The glass window views were breathtaking—definitely 5 stars.

🍽 Food: The quality, taste, and creativity of the dishes were outstanding—easily 5 stars. Honestly, it’s one of the best fine-dining experiences I’ve had in the Netherlands, and far better than the Euromast in Rotterdam with its similar high-rise view.

🤝 Service: The chef was outstanding, and the serving staff & Reception team were excellent—attentive and professional. Again 5 starts.

Overall, this is an extraordinary fine-dining restaurant offering a 360° view of Amsterdam that I believe no other restaurant in the Netherlands can beat. 🌟

L. T.,2,,"Pros: - The restaurant has a fantastic view. You rotate slowly while eating. Cons: - You pay a premium for that view. Dinner costs €70 per person. - For that price, the food was far below par. It was sparse, lukewarm/cold, and tasteless. A lot of the flavors were the same. Little variety. For fries, you have to pay an extra €7. Incomprehensible! - The fries were lukewarm/cold and fried way too hard. They seemed like they had been fried for the second time. After I remarked to the staff about the fries being too hard, nothing was done about it. A missed opportunity! - The staff often spoke English. They would repeat their tune about what ""special"" food you had on your plate. They spoke quickly and disinterestedly. It was incomprehensible. - Moreover, the staff discriminates between customers. If they notice they have some wealthier customers in front of them, they change their attitude. For these people, they even refill their glass of water from the bottle! These customers pay the same as everyone else! - The restrooms aren't clean. This shouldn't be acceptable for a restaurant like this. Conclusion: The view is amazing, but that's what you pay for.

Due to the limited space between the rotating tables and the staff, you hear a lot of student chatter and conversations that we feel are inappropriate for a fancy dinner considering the price. Comments from the kitchen and complaints from other customers are also discussed, some of which we heard. The time between courses was too long, which the staff also felt was appropriate. Furthermore, the staff lacked sufficient training to understand the standard drinks menu. The venue itself was great! Management wasn't visibly present, which we expect from this location.

Moon would rather have a table of four than show flexibility by serving one extra plate, preventing them from ordering the entire menu. Other restaurants do try their best. We've known Moon for years. We've eaten there a few times before. The food is good, but not great. There's little variety in the menu, and the dessert has consisted of the same ingredients for years. The price is great, but in a negative way. We were curious about the new interior, and the combination with Sail seemed like a good opportunity to return. To see if they've actually changed the dessert menu. But that won't happen again. Perhaps management should reconsider what business they're in? Or train their staff better.

Service was mostly good, but one staff member soured the experience by asking if I’d finished a course while food was still clearly on my plate. It felt pushy and disrespectful, as if guests were being hurried out rather than welcomed to linger. In a place built for savoring, that kind of haste is hard to ignore.

Maudie Bergmans,3,,"With a group of four people we went to eat. Unique location where you can turn around in an hour and have a view of Amsterdam. To start with, the food was great. What a shame was that we were served the amuses, oysters, 1st and 2nd course within 60 minutes. We drank all these courses with the aperitif (prosecco) due to the speed. None of the service came to ask in between if we wanted to drink something else. They only had eyes to see if we had finished eating and to clear it as quickly as possible. Water was not refilled in between and we had to ask for a bottle of wine ourselves. When we asked for the main course if we could wait a bit because the pace was too fast, it seemed as if this was not appreciated. We would indicate when ourselves, but after 15 minutes the service came to ask if it could be prepared and 5 minutes later the food was on the table. We got the feeling that we had to leave the building as quickly as possible. The restaurant has a nice concept, but the service makes the experience substandard. Price quality not in order. Too bad..",Dutch,-0.5,negative

The ribeye was way too salty, in steak tartare the meat taste was overwhelmed by peanuts. The gnocchi and cheese were fine, but nothing really blew my mind. They were nice enough to accommodate with lactose-free version of the dessert, so kudos for that.

When I asked for my drink I waited at least 20 minutes for the waiter to come back to tell me it’s not available. The waiting time between courses was also way too long. After 2nd course I felt like I wanna leave, after 3rd I was sure of it.
