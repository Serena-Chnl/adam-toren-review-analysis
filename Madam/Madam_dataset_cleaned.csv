I left the place without arguing with her. It was a disgusting experience",English,-1.0,negative

Michaela Schulte,4,2025-04-25 07:32:00,"My daughter and I had a very nice evening in the restaurant! In conjunction with the table reservation, we were able to go to the viewing platform free of charge and without waiting in the separate elevator and enjoy the magnificent view. After arriving at the restaurant we were shown to our table, which was slightly elevated on a platform near the open kitchen. As hoped, we had a good view from there while we ate. People can have different opinions about the volume of the music (depending on the generation ;-). The restaurant's young staff were very attentive and friendly. We didn't have to wait long for drinks and our food. It tasted good and was totally priced!!! The deposit we paid when we reserved the table was then credited without me having to point it out. Overall we had a very nice time. Our conclusion: A visit is well worth it if the weather cooperates like we did!!!",German,0.5,positive

Caring Cardiology,2,2025-04-22 20:18:00,"Much as they claim it has global appeal it's a bar food restaurant. They have only 4 items as entree on the menu.  I ordered the Salmon..it is so salty that it tastes bitter. Spoke to the hostess and manager. The French fries that came with it are fair .  Sides of salads is below fair ...after a lot of discussion with the  manager ensued . She  said chef would make a normal version . Amazing he made  1 inch by 1 inch version.  The truth is  very evident without salt.  Salmon is of very low quality with bad smell.  Essentially it's a bar food place not a restaurant . Views are good prices are fair for the location.  Not sure why they don't want to make it special, considering that they are in a unique position....",English,-0.5,negative

Ho Wai Cheung,1,2025-04-18 19:04:00,"Fair experience in this restaurant.

Food like fast food or supermarket food nothing special at all but I know people coming here are enjoying the scenary more than food, but I hope the restaurant can improve its food.

Then, a waitress come to us and suggest us to drink something. I ordered a cup of tenquil sunrise, but my girlfriend did not want to drink, so I ordered the tap water for her. When I pay the bill, I am so shocked and “suprised” that the small glass of tap water with lemon costs €7 (which is more expensive than juices) OH MY GOODNESS!!

Let me supplement a photo to see how “BIG” and how “EXQUISITE” this glass of TAP WATER with a “BIG” piece of lemon. It is the most luxury drink I have ever tried!

Last but not least, this restaurant has limit the meal time in 2 hours.

A little bit disappointing experience, not recommended people coming to Adam’s Lookout to stay here.",English,-1.0,negative

Cello Ka,1,2025-07-20 13:05:00,"Checked the website for tickets for the sky bar for tomorrow night.
For almost a week and still it is saying “tickets available soon”.
Relying on that I waited patiently for an update to book tickets to surprise friends visiting from abroad.
When even today there wasn’t any update I went through the website and on another page it says the event is sold out.
Emailed them & letting them know about this misleading statement on the website.
They didn’t even recognise their mistake nor did they try to find a solution, just only told me to check for tickets at them other resale website.
Don’t get me wrong, mistakes can happen, but their problem solving and customer service is terrible!

Alex P. Jäger,1,2025-03-23 11:07:00,"It's a very chaotic experience at lunchtime: First you have to pay the entrance fee to even go up. Then you have to put down a €10 deposit per person to guarantee you get a seat in a set time slot. When paying, don't forget to mention the deposit, otherwise you'll be wasting those €10 per person. There are only two tables by the window with a direct view of Amsterdam city. All other seats offer a rather disappointing view. The food itself was unfortunately very boring. The burgers were mediocre at best, and the fries were very greasy, small, and unsalted. To pay, you have to go straight to the waiter, as no one comes on their own. In conclusion: The view is fine when the weather is nice, but I don't recommend the food.",German,-1.0,negative

This place is a massive tourist trap. We ordered the steak which is €40 and when it came out it was the size of a croquette and came with two bowls of salad and chips on the side which were larger than the steak itself. The service all night was slow and unhelpful the wine was delivered to our table warm and when we complained about the quality of the steak and after sending it back no one came over to us for a further 25 minutes to apologise or see if we wanted to order another main, staff were rude and ignorant from the moment we arrived.

Bizarre effect. -cold drinks served in plastic cups .Even the wine... -I spoke to the waiter a few times because something was missing from the order. -no one came to ask if everything was okay. - one tablemate was the first to receive her main course while the rest still had to wait. Five minutes later the other main courses were served. And not long after, the starters! -no salt and pepper on the table. -specified receipt could not be printed. Which made control difficult.

Lisa Vandenburgh,2,2024-08-13 09:32:00,"We have been in Amsterdam for 1 week and this was our worse dining experience.  Our reservation was at 8 pm, so we showed up at 7 pm to enjoy a drink at the Sky Bar which is adjacent to the restaurant.  Despite being told there was table service, my husband had to go to the bar to get our drinks as we waited for so long and no one approached us.  We saw many people ordering burger and fries at the Sky Bar and I wished we had just done this, but because you have to leave a deposit with the dinner reservation, we were unable to switch.  We sat down to dinner and again took forever for someone to take our drink order.  We had to ask our server 3 times for my wine.  I ended up going to the bar myself when I needed ice.  We ordered salmon and cod for dinner.  They came out one at a time, just assuming we were sharing.  So we ended up sharing so that we could enjoy our food together.  The salmon priced at over 25 euros was 4 ""salmon rolls"" (like sushi).  They were tasty which is why I gave 2 stars for food.  Much later, we received the cod which portion was even smaller for the price.  On this plate there were only 3 pieces, so that made sharing even more difficult...which goes back to us not wanting to share in the first place.  My best advice is to go to the Sky Bar - the views are exactly the same as the restaurant.  Order bar food and drinks and enjoy.  Don't pay for the Madam restaurant.  Their service is horrible and the meal is very small for the price.  We had to stop for french fries on the way home because we were still hungry.",English,-1.0,negative

So if you are just coming for the view Book Adam’s lookout. Anyways the menu is completely different for the restaurant dine in area and Adam’s lookout. It differs in pricing as well. Overall I really like the vibe and cocktails. The food menu was average and less options I felt. It’s a beautiful place though.,English,0.5,positive
Doris Djehi,4,2024-05-16 14:06:00,"A very suitable place, When visiting Amasterdam it was completely unimaginable not to go there. We were more than delighted to dine in this suspended restaurant which offers an incredible panoramic view. The roof top is very pleasant and offers a magnificent view. The cuisine is meticulous and the servers are very attentive. The menu is very affordable but it is still preferable to make a reservation to be sure of being able to dine there. Finally we went to the Sky bar located next to the restaurant where we could dance to the rhythm of electro music. This is a place that I recommend.",French,0.5,positive

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, with quick responses to questions before the meal. They provided a gluten free alternative for a member of our party.

Most of us had burgers which were absolutely delicious. We also had some gorgeous cocktails. The view was stunning and we booked for sunset, which was beautiful. It was someone's birthday and they brought out some indoor fireworks which was lovely.

The decor was gorgeous. Highly recommend.

Some of us went on the swing on the lookout, which was lots of fun. Beautiful views if Amsterdam. We loved the rooftop bar up here too.

The only negative was that the music was far too loud. We were a party of various ages, from 13 to 75. We all agreed that it was too loud and it was a struggle to hear what everyone was saying. I understand it's a bar as well, but it would have been more enjoyable if the volume was lower. Apart from this I would still recommend, but be prepared for the volume.",English,1.0,positive

Sandra Tornero Luna,1,2025-07-26 14:14:00,"I had a disappointing experience at Madam in Amsterdam last night. The bartender, a dark-haired man with layered hair, was incredibly unclear and evasive about the drink prices.

At first, he charged us €29 for two mixed drinks and a beer, which already seemed excessive. Later, he offered us two free shots, which we appreciated. However, when I went back to order just one drink and a beer, he again charged €29, without any clear explanation. When I asked him to break down the prices, he avoided the question, saying things like “I gave you a shot earlier,” and even poured me a beer I didn’t ask for, claiming it was a “gift” — just to avoid explaining the prices.

My friend also asked him in English how much each item cost, but instead of giving a straight answer, the bartender kept changing the subject. It felt dishonest and left us feeling very uncomfortable.

I don’t mind paying for drinks, but transparency and respect are basic expectations — especially at a high-end venue like this. Unfortunately, this experience left a bad impression, and I wouldn’t return or recommend it.",English,-1.0,negative

I was absolutely not drunk—I was just happy because of the drinks I'd had. All I did was take off my shoes because my feet were sore. David repeatedly claimed he'd warned me, which was a lie. He only said it once, and then he unceremoniously kicked me out. The real reason was clear: because I had declined his friend request and told him I already had a boyfriend. This is unacceptable, discriminatory, and extremely disrespectful behavior. Security guards are supposed to ensure the safety of guests, not abuse their power for personal reasons. I expect you to take this seriously, because this kind of behavior not only damages your reputation but also makes the club an unsafe place for women. Furthermore, I want to emphasize that this wasn't my first visit to your club. That's precisely why it's especially disappointing to be treated this way.

The restaurant sits inside a tourist attraction as as such people are constantly walking past tables to see the views, looking at your food, sitting at empty tables without reservations and knocking into you to stand next to the glass for the best foto.

The menu is small but has a reasonable choice that you could find at least one thing for yourself.

I ordered the schnitzel and have to save I was very disappointed - as it lacked any flavour at all. Not breadcrumbs, the veal, nothing. My colleague choice the beef tenderloin which he said was tender but again lacked flavour other than the sauce.

Timing of dishes: While we were still enjoying our starter, we were brought the main dishes without even giving us time to finish.
Slowness after lunch: Once the meal was over, no one came to clear our table for 20 minutes, which prompted us to ask directly for the bill.
Problem with the bill: I was presented directly with the VCT with a posted amount, but no paper addition. When I asked for a copy, I was told that the printer was not working, finally giving me a paper bill two minutes after paying. It seemed suspicious.
-Tip imposed: I found that a tip was added without my consent. In asking for an explanation, the waitress seemed embarrassed and had to call on her superior. Eventually, I was reimbursed for this tip, but I found it unhonest.

The other day she visited Madam restaurant in the A’DAM Toren tower in central Amsterdam. This place made an incredible impression on me: the stylish interior, the cozy atmosphere and, of course, the stunning views of the city from above.

I ordered a truffle burger and it turned out to be a real gastronomic masterpiece! A juicy patty, a delicate bun, fresh vegetables and a rich truffle sauce all created a harmony of flavors. The portion was impressive and the serving aesthetically pleasing.

The service was top-notch: the waiters are friendly, attentive, and everything was served on time.

I immediately ask how this is possible and they admit that she made a ‘mistake’. Instead of returning my money, they told me that I have to send an email explaining the story. But this email is just being ignored! I feel like they stole €60,- from me.",English,-1.0,negative

Hipguy,1,2024-06-30 02:00:00,"I hate leaving a bad review but when the waiter is talking rudely about your family directly behind you to another staff member (as if you can't hear )that is something I have never experienced in any country. Menus sat on table entire meal, never cleared plates, never offered dessert or coffee. Food is ok but very overpriced which I could live with. Small portions, we actually two hours later had to have a second dinner at a pub with the soccer game. Drinks watered down (old fashioned was more water than bourbon, spicy Paloma was no tequila).  Tall think curly haired waiter needs to probably find a new career.  Was in amsterdam 4 days and thankfully otherwise was fantastic people and service. View was ok but seated far from being able to see it and as we sat we asked if we could sit closer to better view and were told no despite restaurant pretty much empty at that time. This started the rude comments and poor service.",English,-1.0,negative

Nathan J,1,2025-05-31 02:00:00,"Tried to order food at the bar and waited for over half and hour. When I asked them about it they tried to convince me that I didn’t order any food despite having proof that I did. View was very nice, just avoid the bar at the upper level.",English,-1.0,negative
Sorcha B,2,2025-07-01 02:00:00,"The bar was great, staff and drinks were lovely, however the restaurant is extremely disappointing. The staff are unfriendly and the service is shocking. We waited 20 mins to have our order taken and when the starters came out it was beautiful, however when our main dishes came out it was very disappointing. The chicken in the chicken burger is very obviously cooked from frozen, which is not something I expect to be eating for the price of it. The chips were an insult to the dish also. One staff member continuously went over to the table close to us and kept rubbing the other customer on the back in a flirtatious way several times, which is highly unprofessional. We also ordered another drink for my partner, and it took 20 mins again. We had to ask to be given a knife and fork with our meal and when we were given it, the waiter was extremely rude and handed it to us in a very rude manner. The only thing keeping this place afloat is the views and the bar, not that of the restaurant experience. It really ruined our date night and was not worth the money.",English,-0.5,negative
Maria W,2,2025-07-05 02:00:00,"Booked way back in April and asked if gluten and dairy free was possible. I was advised yes no problem. 
Arrived this evening for our booking at 8pm to be advised that they may have very limited options for dietary requirements and also our table wasn’t ready. 
We waited 20 minutes and finally got seated. 
We all ordered. Our main courses arrived to the table but it took an additional 15 mins for our salad and fries which compliments the meat, to arrive. 
The service at the table was awful. You could see the waiters and waitresses trying very hard but the time it took to cook the meals was all wrong and out of sync. 
We were celebrating a special birthday as well as two other birthdays and sadly it’s been our most disappointing experience since visiting Amsterdam.",English,-1.0,negative
Victoria H,1,2025-07-09 02:00:00,"My partner and I had booked a table at the restaurant here quite far in advance. We had enquired about gluten free options prior to our visit and were informed this wouldn't be an issue however when we arrived we were told that due to the fact my partner is celiac we could not be served food due to their policy. When we questioned why we were not told this when we emailed we were told that they catered for those with a gluten free diet but not celiac.  The manager clearly showed no knowledge of what being celiac actually meant, and told us that the £20 deposit we had paid couldn't be refunded in cash and could only be placed behind the bar. So we were left at 8pm with nothing but a £20 bar credit and nowhere to go for dinner! We were very unimpressed with the service and staff here and would not return.",English,-1.0,negative
Romain Chariot,3,2025-07-22 02:00:00,"My wife and I had dinner on a Saturday night at this establishment. Let's be honest: the setting is really top! Nice view, original elevator, trendy decoration worthy of the most beautiful Instagram spots, neat musical atmosphere... The staff is very caring and attentive – we even had a dedicated French waitress, which made the experience even more enjoyable.

On EN kitchen side, however, we were a little less convinced. The menu is quite limited and the dishes offered are rather simple: burrata, small tartare, some EN case... This is clearly not a restaurant designed for a hearty or gourmet dinner. The place is more for those who want to have a drink with friends and snack on something in a nice setting, than those who are looking for a real culinary experience.

EN summary: perfect for a relaxing evening with tapas and cocktails, less suitable for a real full meal.",English,0.5,positive
Sheila N,4,2025-07-30 02:00:00,"El sitio tiene unas vistas increíbles pero la carta es escasa y cara, tardaron mucho en servirnos las bebidas pese a que ya nos habían traído la comida y la camarera nos regaló una botella de agua lo cual valoro muy positivamente. Otra cosa que no me gustó es que el restaurante está compartido con lugar para bailar y la música está demasiado alta lo cual impide que puedas tener una conversación mientras cenas y eso estropea la experiencia. Lo mejor son las vistas sin duda.",Spanish,0.0,neutral
Lea L,1,2025-08-10 02:00:00,"The food was average. The noodles were okay, the burger didn't taste good. When asked about allergens, the waiters could not find answers and did not forward the questions. My plate was always cleared without demand before it was empty. For example, my half full Coke glass was suddenly gone DA the waiter had taken ES. Overall, the whole time you had the feeling that you had to finish as quickly as possible to make room for the next guests. This even though we had reserved.",English,-1.0,negative

RafasP,2,2025-08-25 02:00:00,"Well we don't catch a Friday or Saturday which are ballad days and I can't say about such days.

We went on a Thursday, it was quite full, we had a reservation and it was not the problem, I even paid earlier such a reservation.

Weak table, poor service and we were under pressure because they would close after 1h of the booking time. Absurd! 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND",English,-1.0,negative

Daniel S,3,2025-08-29 02:00:00,"The view of Amsterdam is great. 
Unfortunately, our food was not accordingly: The starter was great, however, our main courses were all cold. Since the food was also a bit more expensive, we were unfortunately a bit disappointed.
In addition, we were only asked very sporadically if we wanted anything else to drink and it also took us a long time to get the bill.",English,0.0,neutral

The food was impeccable, the staff were friendly, attentive and had a sense of humour (which is rare) and the view… there was nothing quite like it, golden hour at the top of A’Dam tower, impeccable food, a fantastic vibe, if anyone is in Amsterdam, get on the waitlist, this is a night you will not forget!",English,1.0,positive
