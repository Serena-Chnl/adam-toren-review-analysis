The table assigned to us was unfortunately still dirty upon our arrival, and it took another 20 minutes before our order was taken. The food was decent, and the location of the restaurant is great. However, the service was disappointing: we had to remind the staff member three times that we would like to pay. Overall, the service did not meet our expectations and somewhat overshadowed an otherwise positive experience.",English,-1.0,negative

Served in a small plastic cup. I prefer to pay more and drink from a real glass. I do understand that serving on the roof is not necessarily done with glasses. The swing is nice and they serve well and are nice. However, a video about swinging is expensive. The elevator experience is fun and entertaining. With VR glasses you can experience the roller coaster atmosphere. The views are amazing on the roof.",Finnish,0.0,neutral

Cassandra LEROY,4,2025-04-10 15:48:00,"We visited the A‚ÄôDAM Lookout tower as a group of 6 people, and overall the experience was nice, but quite expensive for what it is. Access and parking: We parked at the Q-Park at the central station, and paid ‚Ç¨47 for only 3 hours 11 minutes, which is clearly excessive. If you can find a free space on the streets of Amsterdam or use another means of transport, avoid this parking lot. From there, we walked to the free ferry (6 min walk). The ferries leave every 4 minutes and drop you off directly at the foot of the tower. Entrance and ascent to the tower: We had booked our tickets in advance (and we highly recommend doing so!). Entry was after a short 10-minute queue. A photo with a green background is offered to you, but it is optional. The elevator, fast and futuristic, propels you to the top in a few seconds, but be careful: it is full of flashes and light effects ‚Äì to be avoided by sensitive people (especially epileptics). Panorama & restaurant: Once at the top, the panoramic view of Amsterdam through the large floor-to-ceiling windows is truly beautiful. There is also a bar and restaurant on site. We took tickets with access to the restaurant, and even if the prices are a little high (tourism requires), the service was fast, the food decent, and the staff very friendly. Small downside: even having reserved for 6 (4+2), we were not able to eat all together, because they only have a table of 6... which was occupied by 4 people. The swing (Over The Edge): Access to the roof is via stairs. Up there, you have to add ‚Ç¨7 to ‚Ç¨7.50 to do the famous swing above the void. The experience is fun, but very short (around 1min30), and the wait can be long depending on the crowd. Remember to cover up well because it is very windy, and phones are prohibited in the swing (unless someone is filming you from outside or if you entrust it to the staff). You leave with a QR code to collect a souvenir photo with the A‚ÄôDAM Lookout watermark, which is nice. Photo tips: There are a lot of reflections in the windows, so to take good photos, remember to stick your phone against the window and discreetly move any ottomans or distracting items (and then put them back, of course). You can take photos almost anywhere, the space is quite free. Duration of the visit: We planned to stay 2.5 hours, but ended up staying almost 3.5 hours. It's better not to plan anything right afterward to be able to take full advantage of it. In summary: ‚Ä¢ Beautiful panoramic view ‚Ä¢ Nice restaurant but high prices ‚Ä¢ Fun swing but expensive for the duration ‚Ä¢ Good organization but lack of flexibility for groups ‚Ä¢ Original experience, but overall quite expensive: ‚Ç¨25 entry + restaurant + swing + parking = it goes up quickly! It‚Äôs an activity to do once for the view and the adrenaline of the swing, but to anticipate well in terms of budget and timing.",French,-0.5,negative

Then we took the elevator ride up, which came with an exciting laser show. (They warn you in advance that it is not recommended for people with epilepsy.)

At the top, the view is fascinating, and there are both looking glasses and photo shooting points, free to use. Unfortunately, the swing blocks a very nice part of the view, but it‚Äôs not taking away too much. You can easily get a good view on the city and understand it a bit better.

At the beginning two pictures were taken. It said you can download it for free. However, this was not the case and you could only purchase them afterwards.

Update 1: it's 2:30 p.m. I ordered but I still haven't eaten! Will I ever eat? Update 2: I'm eating, I received my hamburger at 2:45 p.m. (1 hour and 45 minutes of waiting, which is better) Well the burger is cold but the fries were hot! Don't go there, it's not worth it!",French,-1.0,negative
Randeep,5,2025-02-17 04:51:00,"Didn't know what to expect from the damn lookout experience, but managed to make it on a pretty clear day and the views from the top were amazing. The lift that takes you up is a experience lift which was really fun. There is a bit of a queue on the way back out when you're coming down as there is only one lift up and down, but the queue is quite quick as the lift is quite large. The actual swing experience was much scarier than I thought it was going to be as it looked quite tame when you were standing and watching people get on it, but when you are hanging over the edge it's quite an experience. Would definitely recommend damn lookout for anybody coming to Amsterdam for something different and fun to do.",English,1.0,positive

Marianne De Somviele,5,2025-02-06 23:36:00,"Luxury lunch and breathtaking view at the A'DAM Tower - a unique Amsterdam experience! For a special family lunch we were looking for a unique location in Amsterdam, and the panoramic revolving restaurant of the A'DAM Tower turned out to be the perfect choice. From the moment we entered everything felt luxurious and stylish. The warm welcome, the elegant entrance and the lightning-fast glass elevator ‚Äì which changed color during the ride ‚Äì immediately made the experience special. Once at the top, we were guided to our table in the 360¬∞ rotating restaurant, where we had a different breathtaking view of Amsterdam each time we ate. This unique effect made our lunch extra special. The dishes were refined and prepared with care, and the highly trained service ‚Äì clearly trained at hotel school level ‚Äì provided excellent service. Everything was extremely professional and hospitable, which brought the culinary experience to a top level. After lunch we wanted to admire the city even closer. Since it was windy, we put on our windbreakers and went to the outside deck. Instead of the well-known 'Over The Edge' swing, we opted for a different perspective: climbing the Horse of Marken, an iconic work of art on the roof of the tower. With our binoculars we zoomed in on different parts of the city, which made for surprising discoveries and impressive panoramic views. The A'DAM Tower offers a unique combination of fine dining, luxury and adventure. Whether you are looking for a special lunch experience, a romantic dinner with a view, or a spectacular skyline experience, this iconic hotspot in Amsterdam is an absolute must-visit!",Dutch,1.0,positive

The VR experience was also a lot of fun, offering a short but thrilling perspective of Amsterdam‚Äôs history and landmarks. For those seeking a bit of adventure, the swing at the top of the tower provides an exhilarating experience with breathtaking views.

Before you take the last stairs to the platform, you have a dry, beautiful view of Amsterdam. There is a bar, a small cinema as well as the history of the building. Once at the top of the platform, there is seating, the view and the swings. We had booked the swings and were the first guests when there was light snow and 0 degrees.

m m,1,2025-01-03 17:17:00,"We have booked the ticket ""A'DAM Lookout Ticket and voucher for lunch or dinner"" online in advance for the early evening of December 30, 2024. The voucher amounts to ‚Ç¨20.00 and can be credited towards the meal. When we arrived at the entrance there was already a long queue. Our ticket gave us no advantage. We had to wait our turn. The time slot booked didn't matter. Unfortunately, progress was slow, as after check-in you have the opportunity to take a souvenir photo, which you can purchase later. When we finally got through the queue, we stood in front of the elevator that was supposed to take us to the viewing platform. In the elevator we were told that we should watch the ""light show"" in the elevator shaft (glass roof of the elevator). Well, what can you say - a few strips of light that wander up and down the shaft and no wow effect. When we finally reached the top, we had the feeling that we had arrived at the influencer training camp. The location was completely overcrowded and you found yourself in a crowd of photo fanatic young people. One had the impression that everything revolves around the perfect photo/video. We went to the restaurant relatively quickly and were seated at the window. The first positive note: the view is breathtaking. However, we didn't have a quiet moment during the meal. The restaurant area is accessible to everyone, which is why the photo fanatics were everywhere. Since we were sitting right by the window, they kept standing around our table and taking photos. It was horror. The food is at the fast food restaurant level and is therefore grossly overpriced. Some of the information on the menu does not correspond to the facts. The club sandwich is not brioche bread, but ordinary wheat toast bread (since I come from the bread nation, I can judge this very well). Finally, we enjoyed the view from the upper viewing platform (located outdoors) and then drove back down. We didn't use the swing because we had to book it separately and neither the weather nor the price appealed to us. However, I am of the opinion that the swing doesn't provide much of a thrill because you don't actually swing over the abyss like you do on the High Swing in Berlin. In summary, one can say: terrible ambience, below-average gastronomy with poor price/performance ratio and poor organization (influencers in the restaurant between the tables should be sent to the ""generally accessible areas"" by the staff).",German,-1.0,negative

M√≥nica Zunino,1,2025-01-01 11:48:00,"The most disappointing experience I have ever had at A‚ÄôDAM Lookout. First of all, the entrance fee is a total rip-off for what they offer. You expect a lot more for the price you pay, but what you get is not worth it. When we arrived at the restaurant for our lunch there was a sign saying ‚Äúplease wait to be seated‚Äù but after waiting 45 minutes in the restaurant, when it was finally our turn, we were informed that the restaurant is by reservation only. Why were we made to wait in the first place if the restaurant only took reservations and they never let us know?

The elevator ride was equally frustrating. They make you look up, supposedly to see a magnificent view, but instead you are greeted with a couple of stupid, poorly designed pictures that they call a ‚Äúlight show.‚Äù Overall, I left feeling completely ripped off and disappointed. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a genuine experience.

I went with my wife and we felt extremely uncomfortable with the approach, as soon as we got off the elevator at the top of the tower we were looking for the toilet which is right next door, but he wouldn't let us go, surrounding us and calling to go up just to distance us from the rest of the group that went up with us, he only asked where we were from and when we said we were Brazilian he started harassing us, he said something about the place's Instagram page, but when we opened the app he inconveniently insisted on seeing my wife's username even after we refused, we were left without reacting and extremely embarrassed by the unacceptable approach by an employee during working hours who then simply turned his back without explaining what the experience would be like. I think it's important to highlight the availability of another employee who even made a point of guiding us in Portuguese with great politeness and that was what in a way saved part of the experience, but the feeling that remains of the place is that it is not safe for women alone!

Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the only downside was it was raining on our trip. Therefore there were no queues but I did feel that the ride was very short and in all fairness this may have been because of the weather. However it didn't put us off and if we visited Amsterdam again and it was sunny I would definitely do this ride again. The views were amazing, even in the rain and the rooftop bar was well designed and we enjoyed a cocktail which I thought was reasonably priced. Uploaded some pictures but we haven't purchased our swing pictures yet, so don't have access to them.

Staff were lovely and helpful and since we attended on a quiet day we hopped on the swing 10 minutes before our booked timeslot after panicking we were going to be late and miss it so just to reassure anyone booking that depending on the day there could be some flexibility with times if needed.

It is better to buy the swing online as it is cheaper than in person. 16.50 EUR for about 2 minutes is a fair price for this attraction, but it didn't bother me personally. That's probably because I know the swing in Berlin on Alex and have a comparison. The swing in Amsterdam is ""solid"" like at a fair, and the swing in Berlin is like it used to be at the playground, where I can still turn myself and have more options. But of course this is a matter of taste. The view is stunning and it was still a great experience! I'll be back. :-)",German,1.0,positive

There are several ticket options, for those who don't like the 3D rollercoaster or even the ""rocking chair"", my suggestion is to buy the ticket + 1 drink, it will be cheaper than buying at the bar. Another tip is to go with time and stay until sunset, the places are in high demand, but if you have time, just wait until most people go to the rooftop, have a drink and go down.

Here you can be prepared for the fact that everything costs something (e.g. including the photos at the beginning, which you tend to be pressured into). Generally a bit too expensive, but still manageable. Tip: Online tickets cost a little less! Otherwise, I can only recommend the elevator with a view, perhaps with the swing as an add-on, but you should be prepared for a rather long waiting time.

He explained everything really well, with just the right amount of humor, helping us get to know the city while having a good laugh. They sell drinks on board; we got Heineken for ‚Ç¨8. The ride lasts about an hour and a half, which is just the right amount of time.

Afterward, we went up to the building, and it‚Äôs a great place to hang out. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt enter the building before the boat and to go back for the swing, so I couldn‚Äôt stay long in the building. Once you leave the building, you can‚Äôt return.

The swing experience was fantastic! There were three of us, and I was lucky to go twice, once with each person. They took three pictures, which wasn‚Äôt quite enough for me, but it was still worth it. They don't let you take pictures while you are in line, so on the left side there is a point where you go up a few stairs and there they come out perfect! The building also has a small cinema, plenty of photo spots, restaurants, bars, and a great souvenir store!

I came after lunch rush and there is only one lady serving and collecting plates. Takes them half an hour to clear a table (while other people ate waiting/looking for a place to sit). It's also not clear how you order your food as nobody directs you and you'll be sitting for ten minutes until the server comes.

I would suggest there be QR codes on table so orders can be placed (like Nandos). Also better signage.

Server looks overworked and underpaid.",English,0.0,neutral

The burger was also not very spicy, too spicy for the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person who doesn't eat spicy food often. It was quite confusing inside the tower because there are two restaurants on one floor. The service was very nice, but it still seemed like they needed more workers there. This did not fail in the rest of the building (one person works and 3 watch). The elevator show was also just mediocre. As with the rest of the tower, rated way too high. So overall it's actually quite okay, but too expensive for the performance.

Positive: Beautiful elevator show above your head as your rise up in 20 seconds. Viewing platform is well laid out and lovely views particularly at sunset time.

The Swing: Reasonable price at 7.50Euro extra. I thought it would be very tame as the swings look extremely solid and only just go over the edge. IN reality I was absolutely petrified, I did not realise I am so afraid of heights until then. I was glad it was over in 2 minutes!

It‚Äôs better to buy tickets online; they were cheaper with us. Take photos for free after checking your tickets (if you don‚Äôt print photos on the way back, of course), two photos with different emotions and then go to the elevator, here you may need to wait quite a bit, after which the elevator will take you to the top floor in 20 seconds. Prepare your camera in advance, because when going to the top you can shoot a small and beautiful light video through the glass roof of the elevator. On the top floor you will have the first level with a panorama through the glass along the entire perimeter of the building, and another floor above (you need to climb the stairs, there will be an open area with additional podiums for photography. Also on this floor there is the highest swing in Europe, they are for a separate fee there is a fee and there is usually a queue for them. There are restaurants on these two floors.

Three photos and a video are created, which you can then buy as a package for just under ‚Ç¨30; a single purchase is almost not worth it.

The elevator does have a light show but not worth the price. On the roof you can look around but everything is an add on extra. The pictures they take at the beginning (they told us was included with our ticket) are ‚Ç¨12.50 per picture. The swing is probably the only thing worth doing. It's only an extra ‚Ç¨8 per person and is a minute long ride. It does go a bit faster than I expected but was exhilarating and a lot of fun. The staff were also very friendly.,English,0.0,neutral

The swing is fantastic! I did it 8 years ago as well and it didn‚Äôt seem as epic back then, but believe me it is an epic experience. You feel as if you‚Äôre about to be flung into the water, but at the same time you feel like you‚Äôre flying. Staff are great and friendly.

The views are spectacular and the swing was great fun to try out.

We relaxed and took our time while there. Besides the views and swing there is not much else to do.

We had lunch unnthe restaurant which was probably wasn't the best meal we had while visiting Amsterdam. The fries were old and had been cooked more than a couple of times so they were pretty dry and sad looking.

The chicken bites were cooked using thigh meat and were gelatinous. Even a family next to us remarked how theres were fatty.

The burgers were lacking flavour and seasoning. The onions had black soot from being either cooked over open flame.

Overall, the food let the experience down.

I would highly recommend visiting, maybe wait until later to get food somewhere else.",English,0.5,positive

Going up the stairs is the outside part with telescopes to see and the swing that rises 100m above the street floor and goes outside the building.

Karim,5,2024-06-11 21:07:00,"My visit to Amsterdam Lookout was nothing short of spectacular. The experience begins from the moment you step into the elevator. The elevator itself is an experience, with an impressive light show that prepares you for the breathtaking view that awaits you at the top. Once at the top you will be treated to a panoramic view of Amsterdam. The city unfolds beneath you in all its glory, with iconic sights such as the canals, the IJ and the historic buildings that adorn the skyline. This view is truly breathtaking and offers countless photo opportunities. One of the highlights of Amsterdam Lookout is without a doubt the Over The Edge swing. This gigantic swing on the edge of the building gives you an adrenaline rush as you swing over the edge of the building, with the city far below you. It's a sensational experience not to be missed if you like a bit of excitement. All in all, my visit to Amsterdam Lookout was unforgettable. It is a must-visit for tourists and locals alike who want to see their city from a new perspective. The combination of the light show in the elevator, the phenomenal view, the exciting swing and the delicious food makes this an experience you will not soon forget.",Dutch,1.0,positive

The views are nothing special, other than the roof of the station there isn‚Äôt much else to look at other than rooftops and tower blocks.

There isn‚Äôt a lot of seating up at the bar so don‚Äôt expect to be guaranteed a seat when you go up there. There is a bit to do while you‚Äôre up there but nothing that nudges this up to 5*.

I heard the light show in the lift on the way up and down is something special but I was left deflated, don‚Äôt have any expectations for it because I did and it didn‚Äôt live up to them.

Manuel Manuel,4,2024-05-20 10:18:00,"Positive: A great experience that you should definitely have if you are in Amsterdam. The free ferries take you directly to the observation tower every 10 minutes from Centraal train station. The view is magnificent, the staff is very friendly and you can relax on the roof with drinks and music on comfortable cushions. The elevator ride is also an experience thanks to the light show. All in all, really worth a visit. Negative: The entrance fees are hefty but still reasonable, in contrast to the extremely expensive prices at the rooftop bar. A 0.25l cola and a 0.5l beer cost ‚Ç¨15 WITHOUT a tip. The queue to get to the elevator is long and it hardly goes any further because everyone takes photos of them which you can then buy at the exit. This should be optional and regulated with a second row. We waited 25 minutes for a photo that we never wanted and didn't buy, like probably 95% of us before us.",German,0.5,positive

The swing itself doesn't last very long, but you have a 360¬∞ view from the terrace, which is definitely worth it.

I put the tickets I wanted to buy into the basket, I already had them at the checkout, I entered my bank card details, but the purchase didn't go through for some reason. I tried several times and it didn't work. I went to the location (A'dam lookout), where the cashier told me that their system was not working, so it was not possible to pay online or on site. Then my bank account manager informed me that my bank card was suspended, because bank card fraudsters controlled the A'DAM LOOKOUT website that night, where they obtained my bank card details and wanted to take my money. I couldn't use my bank card from that moment on. I do not blame the company A'DAM LOOKOUT, but a security protection on the website against fraudsters would be recommended. Others should not run into this, which I did too, so that bank card data is stolen by phishers.",Hungarian,-1.0,negative

We went to the roof terrace to go and do the swing, really good experience and was very quick for us to get on, pretty much walked straight on, I imagine if there was a queue it would move quite quickly

J√∂rg Reichmann,2,2025-05-10 17:35:00,"Another crowded hotspot in Amsterdam. We bought tickets on site. The lady was very stressed and probably didn't feel like it anymore. First we had to wait forever to get to the 1st floor and then another 45 minutes until we got to the elevator. The 10 second lift ride is quite expensive at ‚Ç¨18. Ultimately it is a viewing platform. The highlight: LEDs are incorporated into the elevator shaft and they light up alternately. There is a really great and interesting 360 degree view at the top. Another ‚Ç¨7.50 is charged for swinging, with long waiting times again. We refrained from doing this because there are more spectacular swings. Like everything in the tower, the BAR is very expensive. Coffee, Cola Zero 0.2 l, ginger ale 0.2 l and a mixed starter plate (4 mini spring rolls and 8 bitterballs) were charged at just under ‚Ç¨40. It's a special, nice place, but does everything always have to be so overpriced? There were still dishes lying around everywhere, you didn't know whether anyone was still sitting or not.

Sam M,5,2025-05-09 15:27:00,"If you‚Äôre visiting Amsterdam and looking for a unique view of the city, A‚ÄôDAM Lookout is an absolute must. Located just across the IJ River (a quick free ferry ride from Central Station), this experience offers more than just a scenic view ‚Äî it‚Äôs part thrill, part architecture, and part atmosphere.

The observation deck gives you a 360-degree panoramic view of Amsterdam, and on a clear day, you can see everything from the historic city center to the modern buildings in the North. The glass walls and open-air areas give you the freedom to enjoy the view however you like ‚Äî take photos, grab a drink, or just soak in the skyline.

But the real adrenaline rush? That comes from ‚ÄúOver the Edge‚Äù, the giant swing that takes you over the edge of the rooftop ‚Äî literally. It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart, but it‚Äôs an unforgettable way to see the city, especially as your legs dangle high above the river. Even if you‚Äôre nervous, it‚Äôs over quickly and completely safe ‚Äî plus the staff are friendly and do a great job explaining everything.

Inside, the interactive exhibits give you a cool, tech-forward look at Amsterdam‚Äôs culture, history, and future. There‚Äôs also a bar and restaurant upstairs where you can grab a drink or bite with the view ‚Äî definitely try to time your visit around sunset if you can, it‚Äôs absolutely stunning.

The vibe at A‚ÄôDAM Lookout is fun, upbeat, and modern ‚Äî perfect for couples, families, or solo travelers. Whether you‚Äôre into photography, architecture, or just want a cool view with a bit of a thrill, this is one of the top attractions in the city.",English,1.0,positive

The VR (virtual reality) roller coaster ride was a little too intense for my taste and left me with a sinking feeling in my stomach afterwards. Then we had dinner in the restaurant with a great view and sunset and the food was really delicious. Be sure to try the new cheesecake desserts on the menu. Both really tasty.

There are also lots of large cushions outside on the roof where you can sit down and relax. The permanently installed binoculars are free and great for exploring the surroundings in more detail. A great experience all round.",German,1.0,positive

The view from the swing and the roof is breathtaking! The A'DAM lookout tower has some excellent views. The place is kept-clean and the lifts etc are accessible, even if the swing is not. The magnifying periscopes are free to use and even blur household buildings, which is a nice feature. The lookout tower experience is free with the I AMsterdam program also.

Negatives:
The swing on the top is one-use and you get about 3-4 minutes. (Not 7 minutes as advertised). The entire process feels very capitalistic and targeted to getting every cent from you. Don't bother with the 'virtual tour', it's 1 minute long. 5/7 of the staff were extremely passive-aggressive. The photos are advertised as free, but they charge ‚Ç¨20 and watermark them.

Laura Grazia Spedalieri,5,2025-05-29 20:55:00,"Visiting the A‚ÄôDAM Lookout was one of the most exciting and evocative experiences of my trip to Amsterdam. Access is free with the City Card, a great advantage for those who want to experience something unique without spending a fortune. The 360¬∞ view of the city is simply breathtaking: from the canals to the rooftops, passing through the IJ and beyond, every corner is worth a look. But the real jewel in the crown is undoubtedly the highest swing in Europe, where you are literally suspended in the void above the city. It is a perfect mix of adrenaline, fun and beauty: an absolute must! The atmosphere is lively and engaging: forget the classic soft lounge music. Here there is DJ music at full volume, lights and sensory vibrations that make the experience even more immersive. You almost feel like you are at a party‚Ä¶ 100 meters high! The free photo shoot included in the entrance is also very interesting. In addition to the classic photos with customizable backgrounds and the Amsterdam skyline, there are also real photos taken while you are on the swing, in motion, in the midst of the emotion. An authentic and fun memory to take home, included in the price. To complete it all there is a spacious panoramic bar, with a private area from which to enjoy the view in a more peaceful way, perhaps with a drink in hand. Modern, well-kept and perfectly organized. In short: a complete experience, which combines landscape, adrenaline and entertainment in one place. The A'DAM Lookout is much more than a lookout: it is a must-see if you are in Amsterdam.

–í–æ–≤–∞ –õ—É–∫–∞—à–µ–≤–∏—á - voL4eHok,1,2025-06-05 18:16:00,"A place that is simply not worth the money they ask for. If you pay ‚Ç¨16, all you get is an elevator ride to the top floor and access to the rooftop, which offers a decent view ‚Äî but since the building is located on the edge of the city, you won‚Äôt see anything truly beautiful. It‚Äôs just a distant panoramic view of the city, which would be fine if the price were lower. At least you also get access to a restaurant ‚Äî with overpriced food and tons of dirty tables that no one cleans for over 30 minutes.

But if you decide to buy the full package including the VR rollercoaster and the rooftop swing ‚Äî well, that‚Äôs also underwhelming. The VR quality is extremely outdated: the video resolution is very low, and the objects in the video look like they‚Äôre from the early 2000s. The ride mechanism itself, which simulates a real rollercoaster experience, actually works quite well. Unfortunately, on top of the poor video quality, the VR headset I got was dirty ‚Äî it looked like someone had wiped greasy fingers across the center of the lenses. I asked a staff member to clean it, but it didn‚Äôt help. In the end, I could only see clearly on the edges of the screen.

As for the swing ‚Äî it‚Äôs okay, but I personally didn‚Äôt get much of an adrenaline rush, since even at its highest point, you‚Äôre not that far off the edge of the building. The swing ride itself lasts around 30 seconds, which is very short.

But the cherry on top? They film you during the experience and then generously offer to sell you a 30-second video and 5 photos for ‚Ç¨30 ‚Äî seriously?! So you pay ‚Ç¨30 for the full ticket and get nothing of real value, and then they basically spit in your face and ask for another ‚Ç¨30 for something that should have been included.

I don‚Äôt understand how this place has so many positive reviews. It simply doesn‚Äôt deserve them. If everything ‚Äî including the photos ‚Äî was part of the ticket, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs okay, though still not great. But in reality, it‚Äôs just outrageous greed.",English,-1.0,negative

Dominic R,3,2025-06-14 19:03:00,"It's quite beautiful from the outside, but unfortunately not wheelchair accessible. There's a very steep ramp on the side leading to the entrance, which you'd probably be unable to climb in a wheelchair alone. At the entrance itself, there's a small elevation/threshold of about 5 cm, which also doesn't have any wheelchair ramps. The entrance area itself is, in my opinion, very narrow once you're inside, and the shop on the left is also very narrow in its aisles, although there isn't much of interest there anyway. When I was inside, I only saw stairs and no elevator to get upstairs. All in all, it's a shame that my family couldn't allow my father to visit the observation deck due to the many obstacles for wheelchair users. --- CONCLUSION --- Poorly designed for people with disabilities. Not wheelchair accessible. If there is a way for wheelchair users to visit the observation deck, it's not signposted!",German,0.0,neutral

The viewing platform is a huge experience in itself ‚Äì with panoramic views of all of Amsterdam and its characteristic cityscape.

We also ate in the restaurant, where the food was ok ‚Äì nothing flashy, but fine for the price. The service there was really good, and the staff were both welcoming and efficient. The only small minus was the acoustics in the restaurant, which made it a bit difficult to have a quiet conversation, especially if there were many guests.

The drink prices are high and the kitchen with the food doesn't open until 12 o'clock. Our children were pretty hungry. Our son thought the VR headset was brilliant and it made us parents feel sick.

Traveling G's,4,2025-07-08 00:41:00,"Way up at the top of the A'dam Tower is the lookout and swing.  It didn't really cost much more for us to ride the swing so I decided that I'd wrap up my courage and give it a shot.

Before it was our time slot for the swing we had a couple cold beers in the restaurant.  Watching other people experience the Virtual Reality Amsterdam Ride...my wife decided to check it out.

Making it to the roof on such a cold winter afternoon...we were bundled up and could still feel that cold wind blowing.  Still wasn't too cold to keep us from getting some pictures or dissuade us from the swing.

I am not a fan of heights and was trepidatious to say the least.  When we got in and the swing was moving I was tense.  The view of the city and the entire area was where I kept my focus for the few minutes until we were back down. Much fun...I'd do it again but I'd still be a bit skeered.",English,0.5,positive

All floors had great views of the city, and there were two bars available to use a drink token, including the rooftop bar.

The VR rollercoaster is a lot of fun and would rec, though the headsets are slightly uncomfortable if you're a glasses wearer. Lasts around a minute but I enjoyed a lot.

Rooftop had a bar and unparalleled views of the city. Not a huge amount of seating, nor shade, but worth it.

The swing is good fun - Lasts around a minute also. I was doing well but my belly did definitely drop after one of the looks down!

Good gift shop on the ground floor with competitive prices for elsewhere in the city - also sold ice creams and cold water which was definitely appreciated because it was a HOT day.

Caught the FREE walk-on ferry from/to the Centraal Station, rrally easy and, once over the canal, the building is a short walk from the terminal. In Centraal station, follow signs for the ferry.",English,1.0,positive

I fully understand the rationale and respect that everyone should have the right to access the nice view.

On top of that they have great music and vibes! Dining also available and it‚Äôs perfect for a date!

Laky,5,2025-07-13 18:33:00,"A couple of photo spots, lifts to different levels. Binoculars for lookout, a VR headset rollercoaster experience. A green screen photo session with 3 backdrops you can choose to buy. A double swing that‚Äôs electronic, three photos from the back side and front! Quite nice when it‚Äôs not too busy.

Option to buy tickets online for a discount, lots of sessions of 20 mins each. The swing lasts about 60 seconds not much more. Sounds like a short time but it‚Äôs enough.

Be aware of anti-social social media influencers that want you out of the way so they can make video content - somehow the rules are ignored when they block up walking areas for people traffic.

The VR headsets had sound and technical issues for our group of 3. One person was moved seats and the others had low and no volume.",English,1.0,positive

The VR experience was short but fun ‚Äî a virtual roller coaster that takes you soaring through the city of Amsterdam. It was a great extra to add to the package.

The view from the top of the tower is absolutely stunning. You can see all the iconic landmarks of Amsterdam. Be aware that the bar prices are quite high (as you‚Äôd expect), so I‚Äôd recommend bringing your own water. Still, it‚Äôs worth it for the atmosphere and the view. It wasn‚Äôt too crowded when we visited, which made the experience even better.

Now, the swing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs incredible. The view while you‚Äôre swinging over the edge is unreal. The staff were super friendly ‚Äî although I was surprised by the number of Liverpool fans among them when they saw me in my Newcastle shirt! üòÇ

Jen Darling,2,2025-07-27 18:00:00,"My post is written as someone with a  physical impairment and my review is therefore scored on accessibility.

I found A'dam lookout easy to find, there is a free ferry from the rear of Centraal Station which arrives regularly each way.

The lookout is about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the ferry: under 5 minutes for those able bodied.

There is a set of steps leading up to the entrance. Once you enter you queue up for tickets. I would say this is quite a pricey experience. Booking online saves you 2 euros and you can skip the first queue.
Due to my mobility needs, after I was directed to a flight of stairs I double checked with a member of staff whether there was another way up and was directed to a staff elevator. This took me to the first floor where I queued for my ticket to be scanned and then joined another queue to access the elevator to the top of the building.
There were no places to sit while waiting for the elevator.

Once in the elevator, due to the volume of people waiting, they cram as many people in there and this is very uncomfortable.

Once at the top, or what appears to be the top, there is a VR experience, a room with 2 tv's playing a long advert for the lookout. There are educational boards and a scale replica of the building.

There is a restaurant/bar, but all the tables and chairs are stool height and not catered to those with mobility issues. There is no other seating.
There are toilets, but these are up a set of steps.

Unfortunately the lift does not go up to the roof terrace and therefore there is a whole area you will miss out on if you cannot ascend/descend stairs. Which really should be stated before you handover money.

The journey back down is, again, a long queue with nowhere to sit, before being crammed into a lift and then arriving on the first floor with a guided path leading to a stair case.

Had I known that I wouldn't be able to access the full experience, I wouldn't have done it.

I think that the website could have detailed the accessibility a bit better to enable a visitor with mobility issues to make a more informed decision.",English,0.5,positive

Marvin Born (Thebomcraft),4,2025-07-26 14:17:00,"The A'DAM Lookout is a spectacular observation deck on the roof of the former Shell tower building ‚Äì now A'DAM Toren ‚Äì in Amsterdam-Noord, directly opposite the central station. It can be easily reached in just five minutes by taking the free ferry from Central Station to Buiksloterweg. The visit begins with the elevator, which, with its light and sound effects, becomes a mini-club experience ‚Äì a great introduction to what's to come. Once at the top, you'll be treated to a 360¬∞ panoramic view: the historic city center, the canals, the harbor, and the typical Dutch polder landscape. A total of over 100 meters high ‚Äì ideal for photo opportunities around sunset. A special attraction is the ""Over The Edge"" swing, Europe's highest rooftop swing. You swing over the edge in front of the building ‚Äì approximately 60 seconds of thrills with a view over the city. Users describe the experience as exciting, but shorter than expected ‚Äì some see it more as an Instagram moment than a true adventure. Also available: a VR rollercoaster, interactive exhibition areas on Amsterdam's history and culture, and a revolving restaurant ""Moon"" ‚Äì ideal for drinks with a view. There are also comfortable seating areas such as lounge beanbags and a sky bar feel with a relaxed atmosphere. Tickets cost around ‚Ç¨15‚Äì17 depending on the option. Extras such as the swing or drinks carry an additional charge. Booking is recommended, especially during peak times or if you want to experience the swing. Amsterdam City Card holders often enjoy free admission; the swing costs extra. The entire visit usually takes 1‚Äì2 hours; those who want to use the restaurant or VR offerings should plan for up to 3‚Äì4 hours.",German,1.0,positive

Now initially I was unaware of this place till my wife booked it as a surprise, not keen on heights I was unaware of the swing that also hangs over the side and literally swings you out over the building...
But you know what, it is a great laugh and something you need to experience yourself.

It's high up and they have a VR roller coaster at the top, but queues were long for this,but worth it.

The bar had amazing views as you can see literally 360 degrees from any point of the building once at the top.

From the lights and music in the lift, to the VR roller coaster experience, to the swing hanging off the building, to spots where you can take photos, to the bars and restaurants. Very lovely experience.

They have lockers were you can keep your items if necessary.

One thing that would have been great is if there was clarity on how many times you can go on the rides. The ticket says you can use it from 10am to 10pm, but you can only go on the rides once.

The time slots for the swing ride is also not set in stone. You can arrive earlier or later. Everyone goes on a queue.

I came with my wife and kids, 14 and 11, and they were fully engaged. There were younger kids there too who looked like they were having a great time.

It cost the 4 of us ‚Ç¨110. Cheaper tickets for kids and buying online saves you about ‚Ç¨3 on each ticket.

I would definitely recommend coming here if you are in Amsterdam.",English,1.0,positive

The view is spectacular ‚Äî you can see the canals, cruise ships, and the city skyline. However, the swing ride itself is very brief, lasting only 1‚Äì2 minutes.

Its A Wonderful Life,3,2025-08-13 21:58:00,"A‚ÄôDAM Lookout ‚Äì An Architectural Curiosity with Limited Rewards

From the moment you spot it across the IJ River, the A‚ÄôDAM Lookout stands out with its striking, modern design ‚Äî a bold architectural statement that‚Äôs hard to miss. Unfortunately, for me, that was the most memorable part of the experience.

The day I visited, the skies opened up in a relentless downpour, making the outdoor observation deck inaccessible. Instead, I found myself on the indoor restaurant floor, gazing out over Amsterdam through rain-streaked glass. Yes, you do get a full 360¬∞ view of the city from up here, but truth be told, the most compelling sights of Amsterdam are best discovered at street level, where the city‚Äôs charm truly unfolds.

Thankfully, my visit was included with the I Amsterdam City Card. Had I paid the standard ticket price, I might have felt shortchanged. As an attraction, A‚ÄôDAM Lookout is a modern curiosity rather than a must-do ‚Äî one for architecture enthusiasts or those with a City Card in hand, but not a priority for a short itinerary.",English,0.0,neutral

T K,4,2025-08-15 23:59:00,"The A‚ÄôDAM Lookout in Amsterdam-Noord is a thrilling vantage point that delivers a sky-high perspective of the city‚Äôs iconic skyline. Just a breezy five-minute ferry ride from Central Station, free and fun, with IJ River views, this sleek tower is hard to miss, looming like a modern monolith beside the Eye Filmmuseum. The ‚Ç¨18.50 ticket (cheaper online) grants access to a 360¬∞ observation deck on the 20th floor, where Amsterdam‚Äôs canals, historic center, and distant polders unfold in a breathtaking panorama. The elevator ride, a 22-second blitz of pulsating lights and music, sets the mood for adventure. The ‚ÄúOver the Edge‚Äù swing (‚Ç¨7.50 extra) is the star for thrill seekers, dangling you 100 meters above the ground. It‚Äôs exhilarating, though the 60-second ride feels fleeting, and views are more industrial than Instagram-worthy. The VR rollercoaster adds a fun, if brief, digital dash through Amsterdam. The rooftop bar and Madam restaurant serve pricey but tasty drinks and meals with unbeatable vistas‚Äîbook ahead for dining.

I also did the VR with my other son and my mum. We‚Äôd prebooked 2 of these but paid for the 3rd one on the day (so no need to prebook). This was also a great experience. The sound didn‚Äôt work on my VR pod but it didn‚Äôt take away from the experience.

Long lines to have your ticket scann and then again for the elevator. Before going up, there‚Äôs a greenscreen photo spot where you can pose on a steel beam high in the sky.

The elevator itself is impressively fast, with a spectacular light show projected inside the shaft. Your first stop is the indoor 360¬∞ observation deck. Here you‚Äôll find free telescopes, a bar with prices almost as high as the tower itself (‚Ç¨6 for a soft drink), and after visiting the toilet you can wash your hands with an unforgettable view. There‚Äôs also a scale model of the tower, an info panel about its facilities, and a small cinema showing an informative film about A‚ÄôDAM Tower.

Upstairs, the outdoor 360¬∞ viewing platform offers panoramas behind fences. Signs point out landmarks, buildings, and nearby cities. For fun photo ops, there‚Äôs a huge red horse and big A‚ÄôDAM letters.

On the way down, the elevator treats you to another light show before you exit through the souvenir shop, where the overpriced greenscreen photos are also available.

Swinging on the roof is spectacular, I've never experienced anything like it before. It's an experience you don't get every day, and I have to say, the price-performance ratio is justified ‚Äì the elevator ride with the light show alone is worth experiencing these attractions. However, it's advisable to book tickets online. The combination tickets are recommended! Includes one drink ‚Äì and a super-delicious burger üçî with fries. The bar and restaurant are all glass-fronted, so you have a view of all of Amsterdam ‚Äì simply romantic, amazing, and a breathtaking atmosphere.

Jamie Lang,1,2025-08-31 06:48:00,After lunch at Moon restaurant (excellent) II went into the sky bar and nobody acknowledged me. I found a seat and tried to order using the QR code. It did not work. I tried to get the attention of a server but they would zip by and not acknowledge me. There were women near the bar on their phones. They may have been doing work related messaging but they paid no attention to customers. I ended up leaving frustrated after about 15 minutes. It wasn't that busy.

Forget about canals, museums and other boring things. This is a place for those who are ready to conquer the heights and look at the world from above. Arriving here, you immediately understand: this is not just an observation deck, this is a kind of temple of strength and confidence. First, you go up on a high-speed elevator that literally shoots you into the sky. And when the doors open, you find yourself in a sanctuary, from where all of Amsterdam lies at your feet, like a submissive vassal. The view from here is just giga-high. You see everything: from the famous canals to the noisy train station, and it seems that the whole city is waiting for your instructions. And for the truly brave, there is an attraction called ""Over The Edge"". This is a swing that swings you right over the abyss! This is not for the weak, but for those who are ready to challenge gravity and their own pathetic cowardice. You sit, swing and understand that you are the king of the mountain, and no circumstances will break you. In short, if you are looking for a place to feel like a real giant who looks down on the small fuss from below, then Adam Lookout is your choice. It is worth coming here to prove to yourself and everyone around you that you are not just a tourist, but a conqueror of heights.",Russian,1.0,positive

From the observation deck, you can enjoy spectacular views of the entire city: the canals, the rooftops of the old town, and the bustling water traffic that crosses the canal, connecting Amsterdam North to the historic center. The entrance ticket costs ‚Ç¨25 and includes two drinks, a choice of soda, wine, or beer (note: cocktails are not included). For a small fee, you can try the adrenaline-pumping ""Over The Edge"" swing, which lets you swing suspended in the air, offering unforgettable thrills. The elegant and welcoming Sky Bar is also very pleasant, offering snacks and chips while admiring the view. The facility is easily accessible from Central Station with a free ferry that departs every 10 minutes until 10:00 PM.

The panoramic view from the top is incredible ‚Äì you get a full 360¬∞ view of Amsterdam, including the historic city center, the IJ river, and beyond. Whether you go during the day to see the city come alive or at sunset for a golden skyline, it‚Äôs truly picture-perfect. Definitely bring your camera ‚Äì or better yet, just take it all in with your own eyes. It‚Äôs unforgettable.

Of course, we had to try the Over the Edge swing, and WOW what a rush! Swinging back and forth over the edge of the building, high above the city, was equal parts terrifying and thrilling (in the best way). It‚Äôs a must-do if you‚Äôre even slightly adventurous.

The elevator ride up was also fun fast and full of lights and music, setting the tone for the whole experience. The rooftop bar is a great spot to relax after the swing we enjoyed a drink while soaking in the views and atmosphere.

Everything was well organized, staff were super friendly, and the whole experience felt very smooth and safe.

A‚ÄôDAM Lookout is more than just a view it‚Äôs an experience. Fun, interactive, and totally worth it. Whether you‚Äôre a first-time visitor to Amsterdam or a local looking for a fresh perspective, this is a must-visit spot. Highly recommended!",English,1.0,positive

Deniz A C,4,2025-09-10 15:23:00,"It's perched atop a tall tower, offering panoramic views of Amsterdam. For adrenaline seekers, it's a terrace with activities and a bar. An elevator with a light show accesses this 20th-floor terrace. With its 360-degree sky deck, a swing that lets you soar through the air at the edge of the 20th floor, and a rollercoaster that lets you experience virtual reality, it's ideal for thrill-seekers. The view is truly breathtaking. You can dine at the restaurant and have a drink at the bar. On the ground floor, you can take photos with various concepts. Photoshopped photos create adrenaline-pumping moments. There's also a shop at the exit where you can buy various souvenirs. You can print the photos you take at the entrance or receive them emailed to you for free. It's a must-see if you're short on time in Amsterdam. Free entry is available with the I am Amsterdam Card.",Turkish,1.0,positive

Even if it's short-lived. The free ferry connecting Amsterdam Central Station to the skyscraper is excellent.

The swing on the tower was the absolute highlight, it was the reason we even came. It was such a surreal feeling for the both of us, but in the best way possible.

The views are fantastic, with free to use telescopes and diagrams so you know where your looking, the swing is great although a little scary, the VR ride also really good although made me feel a bit rough when I got off.

Mark Mairs,5,2025-02-24 01:00:00,"Booked for myself and partner in Feb 2025. Get the free ferry across, near Adam Central station. This takes about 5 mins and they run all day. 
We booked the Tower lookout, swing and the VR ride. The VR ride was just OK, doesn't last too long and it is a roller-coaster that takes you around the city of Amsterdam. It was a nice addition to the booking.
The view from the top is stunning. you can see all the famous places of Amsterdam whilst enjoying a cold beer. The prices at the bar 0 probably to be expected - are very expensive, however well worth it when you are enjoying the view. It was not too busy when we went as was out of season, however, I could imagine this being extremely busy in the summer. 
It was interesting watching the video on the towers history (located on top floor before the swing). 
They do have a restaurant, however, I think you may have to book and it did seem to be very expensive. 
The swing itself is amazing. The view was unreal and staff were very helpful. It only lasts around 3-4 mins though which was short enough, but again, to be expected. Would 100% recommend this to anyone travelling to Dam and its something that we would actually to again if we visit in the future.",English,1.0,positive

All these photos taken of you are free! This was great because everyone gets photos from the swing which was an amazing experience to have photos of.

HanKelly,4,2025-02-19 01:00:00,"A‚ÄôDAM Lookout was absolutely worth it! The panoramic views of Amsterdam were stunning from every angle, and the entire experience was well worth the $82.22 we spent for admission. The highlight was definitely the Over the Edge swing, which gave an exhilarating thrill while offering some of the best views of the city. Even the kids had a blast, taking turns on the swing and soaking in the scenery from the observation deck.

Inside, the interactive exhibits and viewing binoculars kept everyone engaged, and we also picked up some great souvenirs from the gift shop, adding an extra $25.40 to the experience. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to see Amsterdam from above, and we‚Äôd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a mix of adrenaline and breathtaking sights",English,1.0,positive
lucyemma,3,2025-02-19 01:00:00,"The lookout (without the Over the Edge experience) is in my opinion, overpriced. The cost to just get to the roof is a lot, especially as the view isn't spectacular, it's just Amsterdam which isn't a very iconic skyline. I try not to be pessimistic and look for the silver lining, but the cost to go up is too much. Yes - the elevator ride is a bit fun, yes there are food and drink options, and of course the swing, but those are all extras to an initial too-high price. If they bring the entry price down, it'd be more compatible with the level of the experience.",English,0.0,neutral

The tickets were reasonable and the roof top offered panoramic views of the city and surrounding area. There‚Äôs a bar and some artwork on the top to enjoy, including a red horse you can sit on.

We then took the lift right to the top and were subject to an amazing light show on the way up! 

Up on the roof you get to see the most amazing views over all of Amsterdam and the opportunity for some great photos!

The free drink was a small Heineken(only beer available)/wine/coffee or soft drink, either of the deck or bar.
The fun photo, in front of a green screen,on the ground floor after entry, was a laugh before the lift ride to the top.

The Lookout: Views were great and going up in the elevator with the lighting was a nice touch. On the top floor, the views were even better having a great overview of the city.

Over The Edge Swing: Once in a lifetime experience and thoroughly enjoyed this time in the air. Swing lasted for a few minutes whilst swinging back and forth off the top of the building.

Charis C,5,2024-08-06 02:00:00,Easy accessible from the central train station with the free ferry. Amassing 360 views of Amsterdam especially with good weather. I assume the views during sunset hours would be even netter than the morning ones. The swing is a very nice experience not to be missed. It is not as ‚Äúscary‚Äù as it looks and deserves to give a go. Queues for the swing are not long early in the morning and if you go there for this purpose try to be there early. The VR rollecestor is also fun but not something unique. Apart   from the roof top bar there is an indoor cafe that offers table sitting where you can enjoy your drink before you return to the ground! A different experience one should try!,English,1.0,positive

The staff were all very friendly, and helpful, and the drinks in the bar were good, if a little costly. The swing was good fun, just a note, your allocated time is when you should join the queue, but it could take a long time to wait for the 2-minute swing, around 20-25 mins wait for us.

Companion08192237670,1,2024-07-30 02:00:00,"We got the bundle of the view+swing+VR rollercoaster.
If your'e in the area it's totally worth getting to the rooftop for the views of Amsterdam, but don't waste your money on any of their ""extras"".
I was excited for the VR experience they propagate so much, but not impressed. At all.
There were no people in the queue for the VR, yet I had to let the two staff members who were talking to eachother know that I'm standing there, looking at them, to get their attention and to do their job. The seat at my VR capsule was flat, uncomfortable and one of the armrests had been damaged and made my elbow hurt. Not to mention the VR experience being FAR from amazing, and it lasted around a minute. Not worth the money.
At the rooftop, we got on the swing which swings you above the skyline of Amsterdam, once again, lasted very short, not worth the money. They have a big ""no photos"" notice all around the attraction, to prevent you from taking your own pictures, of course, because they take them for you and very generously offer you to PURCHASE them at their website. Don't worry, because if you follow the QR code on your photopass, you can just take a screenshot of your photos, without paying a dime.

We purchased the tower and swing tickets, hopped in line, and enjoyed the light show in the elevator on the way up. The first level is packed with amenities: Ma'Dam restaurant and bar, washrooms, tiny lockers, and stairs leading to the top. Plus, you get an enclosed 360-degree view!

The top level is where the magic happens: a bar, smoking area, raised platforms for unobstructed photos, the iconic A'Dam sign, lounge pillows, and the SWING! 

We had gorgeous weather, making the swing experience even better. Before swinging, you can stash your items in a basket in front of your swing. The swing felt incredibly safe, and we soared out over the edge about 25-26 times‚Äîpure exhilaration! Don't forget to keep the QR code for your swing photos.

After the swing, we enjoyed delicious burgers and fries at the restaurant. The little tubes of mayo are a genius idea! We were lucky to snag seating with a view in the Ma'Dam corner.

Sere,2,2024-06-25 02:00:00,"I had a day in Amsterdam and decided to check it out despite the very high price (‚Ç¨26 for going to the roof of the tower + doing a 1 minute experience on the swing) since I had read good reviews. Sadly, it's a tourist trap.

If you're looking to sit on the roof for the entire afternoon, then it might be worth it, as it's a nice enough environment, but if you're actually there for the view, there isn't much to see, as there is either a grate or glass and so you can't even take a good picture, and you pretty much see all there is to see in a couple of minutes.

The swing itself... It was going a bit too fast for my taste, so I didn't enjoy it as much. The staff was lovely (and the only reason why it's a 2 star review instead of 1 star), but the experience is really only good for Instagram, as they take some pictures of you.

The biggest rip-off is at the end: when you do the swing, they give you a piece of paper with a QR code. Before you leave, you scan it into a machine and you have the option to buy the photos: 3 printed photos for ‚Ç¨25 plus an additional ‚Ç¨5 if you also want to download the digital versions. The photos were cute so I bought them for ‚Ç¨25 (a HUGE amount for what they are), only to find out that... If you scan the QR code on your phone, you can actually download them for free!

I learnt that as long as I look outwards and not down then it was fine and I could enjoy the view!

Ben White,5,2024-05-27 02:00:00,"We were so lucky to be blessed with a sunny day when we visited A'DAM Lookout.
There's a very short free ferry ride which leave every 15 minutes I believe, which goes from Centraal Station. Make sure you get on the one that says Veerkade Noord.
There was very short queue to get in and there's a pleasant suprise in the elevator, so if you're scared of elevators this should help. You get a fridge magnet included in your ticket price, there's a restaurant inside as well as a viewing platform which is inside and toilets.
We also paid to go on the swing which is a definite, if you're looking for an adrenaline rush and want to soak up a gorgeous view on Amsterdam. At the top, they have oversized beang bags and a bar so perfect to chill with friends and get drunk.

Feeling hungover from the night before, we took a hassle free ferry over from Amsterdam Centraal and followed in the direction of the big tower! 
Barely any queues, we eased through with our QR codes and took a disco lift that took you up many floors in a blink of an eye! ( There is a green room set up on entry to have pictures took which are really well presented and are great memory keepsakes) 
And when we got to the very top‚Ä¶..WOW‚Ä¶..this was my very first visit to the Dam and what a focal point to see it all from. Views for miles and so many photos to take! 
I didn‚Äôt really know much to why this tower was here, but after watching videos and reading up, I see now this is the work of pure genius. Not only is it the best viewing platform to see the whole of  Amsterdam but it sports a hotel, a nightclub, a bar, an interactive games platform and a revolving restaurant‚Ä¶.it really ticks all boxes. 
With my entry that I pre booked weeks before online, I also added the ‚ÄúOver the Edge‚Äù swing experience‚Ä¶..I was hoping that my partner would be too jaded from the night before to go on it, but sadly not! I‚Äôm completely terrified of heights so cannot understand why I thought it would be a good thing to do??! But I did it, I nearly passed out on the damn thing through fear, but I‚Äôve kept every picture and video they recorded of us to prove I went on the highest swing in Europe‚Ä¶.even if it was the worst 2 mins of my life!!! 
So yes this is a must‚Ä¶..even if your eyes are closed through it!!! 
A well deserved birthday prosecco was needed in the Madam bar afterwords to calm my nerves and take in the wonder of Amsterdam. 
Following this I booked the VR  Rollercoaster experience which was great fun, an interactive ride through Amsterdam was different, exhilarating and I didn‚Äôt want it to end. 
There are ‚Äúinsta‚Äù photo opportunities galore in this place with a red horse and huge Adam sign to sit on right at the top, as well as the awesome views‚Ä¶.
We finished this off with a four course tasting lunch menu in the Moon revolving restaurant which was absolutely perfect in every way.

Then the ""Over the Edge"" swing, which hangs 100 meters high on the side of the tower, (the highest in Europe, they say) provides a unique adrenaline experience.

Warning, there isn't much sun protection while on the observation deck. Bring sunscreen! Overall we spent a little under an hour viewing the sites and taking great photos. Catching the ferry over is free, but can get busy with all the tourist and bikers.",English,1.0,positive
CAG1,5,2025-06-29 02:00:00,"Took ferry over ( bonus as free ). On entry got the tokens for drink we paid for . Glad we didn‚Äôt choose food as so many places in Amsterdam but enjoyed the drink with view .

Great view . Lucky with a good summer‚Äôs day . Spent ages looking down . Lovely tourist attraction .",English,1.0,positive

No lines, great view. We didn‚Äôt partake in the swing (chickens)
We enjoyed lunch and drinks, while overlooking the city of Amsterdam.

CH200,5,2025-07-10 02:00:00,"We LOVED our visit to the top of A'dam Tower. The swing was outstanding - very secure and well run. And, of couse, the view is incredible. We also enjoyed our break in the bar with excellent cocktails & food.",English,1.0,positive
Michael U,4,2025-07-17 02:00:00,"Just ten minutes from Centrum via ferry the A'DAM Lookout is an all-in-one hotel, overlook, bar, restaurant and amusement park.  Easy to access and navigate guests travel up 20 stories in an elevator with light-show before choosing a VR Rollercoaster, over-the-edge swing or dinner.  Touristy, with prices to match, staff is pleasant and everything is operated with safety and proficiency.",English,1.0,positive
Eden263,4,2025-07-18 02:00:00,"I always like to go up a tower, so I was looking forward to this! It wasn‚Äôt too busy, so there wasn‚Äôt much of a wait. The lift (elevator) has a fancy light thing in the ceiling, which is a bit of fun. The view from the top was great! It was very windy, of course, but you can look out from the windows in the bar if the wind is too much! There‚Äôs also a film showing the awesome firework and drone display from a New Year‚Äôs Eve, and another film telling the story of the tower‚Äôs history and how it came to be transformed into the multi-purpose entertainment centre it is today.",English,0.5,positive

Louise l,5,2025-08-02 02:00:00,"We visted Adams Lookout after This is Holland . We firstly had a VR ride on the roller coaster.  My daughter loved this but I wasn't impressed (not sure if faulty as it was very blurry). We then went up to the sky deck. Enjoyed a waffle and a drink, good atmosphere with the music playing. Decided to go on the swing which was a fab experience. The lift up and down was good fun with the lightshow. Great views for photos. Would recommend",English,1.0,positive

L T,5,2025-08-10 02:00:00,"Loved this! Best thing to do in Amsterdam after a canal boat trip. Brilliant views, the swings were great and the rollercoaster was amazing. Will definitely do it all again if I return to Amsterdam.",English,1.0,positive
Petmo68,5,2025-08-12 02:00:00,"My 10 yo son and I visited the ADAM Lookout and combined it with the VR Rollercoaster and Swing options.  The view from the observation deck is amazing (luckily we had a clear day).  To make the most of the time up there I do recommend that you combine it with the other activities that are available.  The VR roller-coaster was good and the Swing was brilliant - my only criticism would be that the swing ride wasn't long enough.  Overall, with the added activities, it was a good way to spend an hour or so",English,1.0,positive
mmiceli86,5,2025-08-16 02:00:00,"The swing is an absolute blast! It‚Äôs thrilling without being too intimidating, and the VR experience adds an extra layer of fun. Plus, they provide free photos to download afterwards, so you can capture all the excitement without paying extra.

If you‚Äôre visiting Amsterdam, this is definitely a must-do activity for a memorable and fun experience!",English,1.0,positive
Zap D,5,2025-08-22 02:00:00,"A'dam Lookout is an observation deck on a 100-metre high tower that allows you to enjoy spectacular, panoramic views of Amsterdam. Entry to the observation desk is free with the I amsterdam card, otherwise you'll have to pay ‚Ç¨16,50 for a standard adult ticket, which it is better to buy online as it's ‚Ç¨2 cheaper. If you'd like to get on the swing, you'll have to pay another ‚Ç¨7,50, and you can also get combination tickets which include food, drinks and a VR rollercoaster ride.

Although I really enjoyed this site, I wouldn't say that it's a must-see. However, if you've got some spare time and you enjoy city views, it's worth checking it out.",English,1.0,positive
danielkooren2003,5,2025-09-11 02:00:00,"A really nice experience! Staff are super friendly and the elevator up/down is really great. You really have the best view on clear days and you can really look around for hours! For the thrill fans there is a swing on the roof of the tower and you can do another VR roller coaster ride through Amsterdam. I did this with the Stadspas promotion, but the prices at the checkout are fine! Before or after your visit you can also check the shop for nice souvenirs / gadgets. I really come back more often!",English,1.0,positive

Joshua T,4,2025-10-02 02:00:00,"Really fun experience, we got great photos on the sky deck, the swing was fun (though a very short 90 second ride) and we also did the VR rollercoaster experience.
