The table assigned to us was unfortunately still dirty upon our arrival, and it took another 20 minutes before our order was taken. The food was decent, and the location of the restaurant is great. However, the service was disappointing: we had to remind the staff member three times that we would like to pay. Overall, the service did not meet our expectations and somewhat overshadowed an otherwise positive experience.",English,-1.0,negative

Served in a small plastic cup. I prefer to pay more and drink from a real glass. I do understand that serving on the roof is not necessarily done with glasses. The swing is nice and they serve well and are nice. However, a video about swinging is expensive. The elevator experience is fun and entertaining.

Cassandra LEROY,4,2025-04-10 15:48:00,"We visited the A‚ÄôDAM Lookout tower as a group of 6 people, and overall the experience was nice, but quite expensive for what it is. Access and parking: We parked at the Q-Park at the central station, and paid ‚Ç¨47 for only 3 hours 11 minutes, which is clearly excessive. If you can find a free space on the streets of Amsterdam or use another means of transport, avoid this parking lot. From there, we walked to the free ferry (6 min walk). The ferries leave every 4 minutes and drop you off directly at the foot of the tower. Entrance and ascent to the tower: We had booked our tickets in advance (and we highly recommend doing so!). Entry was after a short 10-minute queue. A photo with a green background is offered to you, but it is optional. The elevator, fast and futuristic, propels you to the top in a few seconds, but be careful: it is full of flashes and light effects ‚Äì to be avoided by sensitive people (especially epileptics). Panorama & restaurant: Once at the top, the panoramic view of Amsterdam through the large floor-to-ceiling windows is truly beautiful. There is also a bar and restaurant on site. We took tickets with access to the restaurant, and even if the prices are a little high (tourism requires), the service was fast, the food decent, and the staff very friendly. Small downside: even having reserved for 6 (4+2), we were not able to eat all together, because they only have a table of 6... which was occupied by 4 people. The swing (Over The Edge): Access to the roof is via stairs. Up there, you have to add ‚Ç¨7 to ‚Ç¨7.50 to do the famous swing above the void. The experience is fun, but very short (around 1min30), and the wait can be long depending on the crowd. Remember to cover up well because it is very windy, and phones are prohibited in the swing (unless someone is filming you from outside or if you entrust it to the staff). You leave with a QR code to collect a souvenir photo with the A‚ÄôDAM Lookout watermark, which is nice. Photo tips: There are a lot of reflections in the windows, so to take good photos, remember to stick your phone against the window and discreetly move any ottomans or distracting items (and then put them back, of course). You can take photos almost anywhere, the space is quite free. Duration of the visit: We planned to stay 2.5 hours, but ended up staying almost 3.5 hours. It's better not to plan anything right afterward to be able to take full advantage of it. In summary: ‚Ä¢ Beautiful panoramic view ‚Ä¢ Nice restaurant but high prices ‚Ä¢ Fun swing but expensive for the duration ‚Ä¢ Good organization but lack of flexibility for groups ‚Ä¢ Original experience, but overall quite expensive: ‚Ç¨25 entry + restaurant + swing + parking = it goes up quickly! It‚Äôs an activity to do once for the view and the adrenaline of the swing, but to anticipate well in terms of budget and timing.",French,-0.5,negative

We went with a basic entry ticket, and were pleasantly surprised by the very accurate model of Amsterdam right upon entry - this is something we didn‚Äôt see anywhere else and it was nice to have a bird view on the city.

Then we took the elevator ride up, which came with an exciting laser show. (They warn you in advance that it is not recommended for people with epilepsy.)

At the top, the view is fascinating, and there are both looking glasses and photo shooting points, free to use. Unfortunately, the swing blocks a very nice part of the view, but it‚Äôs not taking away too much. You can easily get a good view on the city and understand it a bit better.

At the beginning two pictures were taken. It said you can download it for free. However, this was not the case and you could only purchase them afterwards.

Update 1: it's 2:30 p.m. I ordered but I still haven't eaten! Will I ever eat? Update 2: I'm eating, I received my hamburger at 2:45 p.m. (1 hour and 45 minutes of waiting, which is better) Well the burger is cold but the fries were hot! Don't go there, it's not worth it!",French,-1.0,negative
Randeep,5,2025-02-17 04:51:00,"Didn't know what to expect from the damn lookout experience, but managed to make it on a pretty clear day and the views from the top were amazing. The lift that takes you up is a experience lift which was really fun. There is a bit of a queue on the way back out when you're coming down as there is only one lift up and down, but the queue is quite quick as the lift is quite large. The actual swing experience was much scarier than I thought it was going to be as it looked quite tame when you were standing and watching people get on it, but when you are hanging over the edge it's quite an experience. Would definitely recommend damn lookout for anybody coming to Amsterdam for something different and fun to do.",English,1.0,positive

Marianne De Somviele,5,2025-02-06 23:36:00,"Luxury lunch and breathtaking view at the A'DAM Tower - a unique Amsterdam experience! For a special family lunch we were looking for a unique location in Amsterdam, and the panoramic revolving restaurant of the A'DAM Tower turned out to be the perfect choice. From the moment we entered everything felt luxurious and stylish. The warm welcome, the elegant entrance and the lightning-fast glass elevator ‚Äì which changed color during the ride ‚Äì immediately made the experience special. Once at the top, we were guided to our table in the 360¬∞ rotating restaurant, where we had a different breathtaking view of Amsterdam each time we ate. This unique effect made our lunch extra special. The dishes were refined and prepared with care, and the highly trained service ‚Äì clearly trained at hotel school level ‚Äì provided excellent service. Everything was extremely professional and hospitable, which brought the culinary experience to a top level. After lunch we wanted to admire the city even closer. Since it was windy, we put on our windbreakers and went to the outside deck. Instead of the well-known 'Over The Edge' swing, we opted for a different perspective: climbing the Horse of Marken, an iconic work of art on the roof of the tower. With our binoculars we zoomed in on different parts of the city, which made for surprising discoveries and impressive panoramic views. The A'DAM Tower offers a unique combination of fine dining, luxury and adventure. Whether you are looking for a special lunch experience, a romantic dinner with a view, or a spectacular skyline experience, this iconic hotspot in Amsterdam is an absolute must-visit!",Dutch,1.0,positive

One of the highlights was the elevator ride to the top, which featured an amazing light show that made the journey exciting. Once at the top, the panoramic view of Amsterdam was absolutely stunning‚Äîa perfect spot to take in the city‚Äôs beauty.

The VR experience was also a lot of fun, offering a short but thrilling perspective of Amsterdam‚Äôs history and landmarks. For those seeking a bit of adventure, the swing at the top of the tower provides an exhilarating experience with breathtaking views.

Before you can see a miniature image of Amsterdam, which was beautifully done. The elevator is open at the top (glass pane and you can see a light installation), done cool. Before you take the last stairs to the platform, you have a dry, beautiful view of Amsterdam. There is a bar, a small cinema as well as the history of the building. Once at the top of the platform, there is seating, the view and the swings. We had booked the swings and were the first guests when there was light snow and 0 degrees.

m m,1,2025-01-03 17:17:00,"We have booked the ticket ""A'DAM Lookout Ticket and voucher for lunch or dinner"" online in advance for the early evening of December 30, 2024. The voucher amounts to ‚Ç¨20.00 and can be credited towards the meal. When we arrived at the entrance there was already a long queue. Our ticket gave us no advantage. We had to wait our turn. The time slot booked didn't matter. Unfortunately, progress was slow, as after check-in you have the opportunity to take a souvenir photo, which you can purchase later. When we finally got through the queue, we stood in front of the elevator that was supposed to take us to the viewing platform. In the elevator we were told that we should watch the ""light show"" in the elevator shaft (glass roof of the elevator). Well, what can you say - a few strips of light that wander up and down the shaft and no wow effect. When we finally reached the top, we had the feeling that we had arrived at the influencer training camp. The location was completely overcrowded and you found yourself in a crowd of photo fanatic young people. One had the impression that everything revolves around the perfect photo/video. We went to the restaurant relatively quickly and were seated at the window. The first positive note: the view is breathtaking. However, we didn't have a quiet moment during the meal. The restaurant area is accessible to everyone, which is why the photo fanatics were everywhere. Since we were sitting right by the window, they kept standing around our table and taking photos. It was horror. The food is at the fast food restaurant level and is therefore grossly overpriced. Some of the information on the menu does not correspond to the facts. The club sandwich is not brioche bread, but ordinary wheat toast bread (since I come from the bread nation, I can judge this very well). Finally, we enjoyed the view from the upper viewing platform (located outdoors) and then drove back down. We didn't use the swing because we had to book it separately and neither the weather nor the price appealed to us. However, I am of the opinion that the swing doesn't provide much of a thrill because you don't actually swing over the abyss like you do on the High Swing in Berlin. In summary, one can say: terrible ambience, below-average gastronomy with poor price/performance ratio and poor organization (influencers in the restaurant between the tables should be sent to the ""generally accessible areas"" by the staff).",German,-1.0,negative

M√≥nica Zunino,1,2025-01-01 11:48:00,"The most disappointing experience I have ever had at A‚ÄôDAM Lookout. First of all, the entrance fee is a total rip-off for what they offer. You expect a lot more for the price you pay, but what you get is not worth it. When we arrived at the restaurant for our lunch there was a sign saying ‚Äúplease wait to be seated‚Äù but after waiting 45 minutes in the restaurant, when it was finally our turn, we were informed that the restaurant is by reservation only. Why were we made to wait in the first place if the restaurant only took reservations and they never let us know?

The elevator ride was equally frustrating. They make you look up, supposedly to see a magnificent view, but instead you are greeted with a couple of stupid, poorly designed pictures that they call a ‚Äúlight show.‚Äù Overall, I left feeling completely ripped off and disappointed. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a genuine experience.

Last but not least, upon entering the building, there is a complete lack of security control, which felt concerning and highly irresponsible.",English,-1.0,negative

I went with my wife and we felt extremely uncomfortable with the approach, as soon as we got off the elevator at the top of the tower we were looking for the toilet which is right next door, but he wouldn't let us go, surrounding us and calling to go up just to distance us from the rest of the group that went up with us, he only asked where we were from and when we said we were Brazilian he started harassing us, he said something about the place's Instagram page, but when we opened the app he inconveniently insisted on seeing my wife's username even after we refused, we were left without reacting and extremely embarrassed by the unacceptable approach by an employee during working hours who then simply turned his back without explaining what the experience would be like. I think it's important to highlight the availability of another employee who even made a point of guiding us in Portuguese with great politeness and that was what in a way saved part of the experience, but the feeling that remains of the place is that it is not safe for women alone!

Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the only downside was it was raining on our trip. Therefore there were no queues but I did feel that the ride was very short and in all fairness this may have been because of the weather. However it didn't put us off and if we visited Amsterdam again and it was sunny I would definitely do this ride again. The views were amazing, even in the rain and the rooftop bar was well designed and we enjoyed a cocktail which I thought was reasonably priced. Uploaded some pictures but we haven't purchased our swing pictures yet, so don't have access to them.

Staff were lovely and helpful and since we attended on a quiet day we hopped on the swing 10 minutes before our booked timeslot after panicking we were going to be late and miss it so just to reassure anyone booking that depending on the day there could be some flexibility with times if needed.

It is better to buy the swing online as it is cheaper than in person. 16.50 EUR for about 2 minutes is a fair price for this attraction, but it didn't bother me personally. That's probably because I know the swing in Berlin on Alex and have a comparison. The swing in Amsterdam is ""solid"" like at a fair, and the swing in Berlin is like it used to be at the playground, where I can still turn myself and have more options.

There are several ticket options, for those who don't like the 3D rollercoaster or even the ""rocking chair"", my suggestion is to buy the ticket + 1 drink, it will be cheaper than buying at the bar. Another tip is to go with time and stay until sunset, the places are in high demand, but if you have time, just wait until most people go to the rooftop, have a drink and go down. After sunset, there is a program with DJs who play at the house.",Portuguese,1.0,positive

Here you can be prepared for the fact that everything costs something (e.g. including the photos at the beginning, which you tend to be pressured into). Generally a bit too expensive, but still manageable. Tip: Online tickets cost a little less! Otherwise, I can only recommend the elevator with a view, perhaps with the swing as an add-on, but you should be prepared for a rather long waiting time.

I was looking for boat tours, and when I found out they offered them, I didn‚Äôt hesitate. The boat was nice; covered and comfortable and the captain was excellent! He explained everything really well, with just the right amount of humor, helping us get to know the city while having a good laugh. They sell drinks on board; we got Heineken for ‚Ç¨8. The ride lasts about an hour and a half, which is just the right amount of time.

Afterward, we went up to the building, and it‚Äôs a great place to hang out. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt enter the building before the boat and to go back for the swing, so I couldn‚Äôt stay long in the building. Once you leave the building, you can‚Äôt return.

The swing experience was fantastic! There were three of us, and I was lucky to go twice, once with each person. They took three pictures, which wasn‚Äôt quite enough for me, but it was still worth it. They don't let you take pictures while you are in line, so on the left side there is a point where you go up a few stairs and there they come out perfect! The building also has a small cinema, plenty of photo spots, restaurants, bars, and a great souvenir store!

I came after lunch rush and there is only one lady serving and collecting plates. Takes them half an hour to clear a table (while other people ate waiting/looking for a place to sit). It's also not clear how you order your food as nobody directs you and you'll be sitting for ten minutes until the server comes.

I would suggest there be QR codes on table so orders can be placed (like Nandos). Also better signage.

Server looks overworked and underpaid.",English,0.0,neutral

The burger was also not very spicy, too spicy for the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person who doesn't eat spicy food often. It was quite confusing inside the tower because there are two restaurants on one floor. The service was very nice, but it still seemed like they needed more workers there. This did not fail in the rest of the building (one person works and 3 watch). The elevator show was also just mediocre. As with the rest of the tower, rated way too high. So overall it's actually quite okay, but too expensive for the performance.

I appreciate this commercial gesture, which will undoubtedly allow me to return there during my next stay in Amsterdam. THANKS",French,1.0,positive

Positive: Beautiful elevator show above your head as your rise up in 20 seconds. Viewing platform is well laid out and lovely views particularly at sunset time.

The Swing: Reasonable price at 7.50Euro extra. I thought it would be very tame as the swings look extremely solid and only just go over the edge. IN reality I was absolutely petrified, I did not realise I am so afraid of heights until then. I was glad it was over in 2 minutes!

It‚Äôs better to buy tickets online; they were cheaper with us. Take photos for free after checking your tickets (if you don‚Äôt print photos on the way back, of course), two photos with different emotions and then go to the elevator, here you may need to wait quite a bit, after which the elevator will take you to the top floor in 20 seconds. Prepare your camera in advance, because when going to the top you can shoot a small and beautiful light video through the glass roof of the elevator. On the top floor you will have the first level with a panorama through the glass along the entire perimeter of the building, and another floor above (you need to climb the stairs, there will be an open area with additional podiums for photography. Also on this floor there is the highest swing in Europe, they are for a separate fee there is a fee and there is usually a queue for them. There are restaurants on these two floors.

The elevator does have a light show but not worth the price. On the roof you can look around but everything is an add on extra. The pictures they take at the beginning (they told us was included with our ticket) are ‚Ç¨12.50 per picture. The swing is probably the only thing worth doing. It's only an extra ‚Ç¨8 per person and is a minute long ride. It does go a bit faster than I expected but was exhilarating and a lot of fun. The staff were also very friendly.,English,0.0,neutral

To be clear, we changed our minds before we even got the tickets from the front desk in which one of the employees, Erik, was helping us. When we asked for a refund, Erik asked us fill out a document where we put our name and email address. He said he will add the reason why we are asking for a refund. He then proceeded to tell us that he was not sure that we would get our money back which was frustrating and definitely not reassuring. We are really hoping that we will get our money back.

The swing is fantastic! I did it 8 years ago as well and it didn‚Äôt seem as epic back then, but believe me it is an epic experience. You feel as if you‚Äôre about to be flung into the water, but at the same time you feel like you‚Äôre flying. Staff are great and friendly.

You can spend time waiting for your time slot not in a line but at the bars and restaurants on the roof.,English,1.0,positive

JJ Sheridan,4,2024-07-11 19:50:00,"We visited the A'DAM while on holidays and it was a pretty enjoyable experience.

The views are spectacular and the swing was great fun to try out.

We relaxed and took our time while there. Besides the views and swing there is not much else to do.

We had lunch unnthe restaurant which was probably wasn't the best meal we had while visiting Amsterdam. The fries were old and had been cooked more than a couple of times so they were pretty dry and sad looking.

The chicken bites were cooked using thigh meat and were gelatinous. Even a family next to us remarked how theres were fatty.

The burgers were lacking flavour and seasoning. The onions had black soot from being either cooked over open flame.

Overall, the food let the experience down.

I would highly recommend visiting, maybe wait until later to get food somewhere else.",English,0.5,positive

Karim,5,2024-06-11 21:07:00,"My visit to Amsterdam Lookout was nothing short of spectacular. The experience begins from the moment you step into the elevator. The elevator itself is an experience, with an impressive light show that prepares you for the breathtaking view that awaits you at the top. Once at the top you will be treated to a panoramic view of Amsterdam. The city unfolds beneath you in all its glory, with iconic sights such as the canals, the IJ and the historic buildings that adorn the skyline. This view is truly breathtaking and offers countless photo opportunities. One of the highlights of Amsterdam Lookout is without a doubt the Over The Edge swing. This gigantic swing on the edge of the building gives you an adrenaline rush as you swing over the edge of the building, with the city far below you. It's a sensational experience not to be missed if you like a bit of excitement. All in all, my visit to Amsterdam Lookout was unforgettable. It is a must-visit for tourists and locals alike who want to see their city from a new perspective. The combination of the light show in the elevator, the phenomenal view, the exciting swing and the delicious food makes this an experience you will not soon forget.",Dutch,1.0,positive

The views are nothing special, other than the roof of the station there isn‚Äôt much else to look at other than rooftops and tower blocks.

There isn‚Äôt a lot of seating up at the bar so don‚Äôt expect to be guaranteed a seat when you go up there. There is a bit to do while you‚Äôre up there but nothing that nudges this up to 5*.

I heard the light show in the lift on the way up and down is something special but I was left deflated, don‚Äôt have any expectations for it because I did and it didn‚Äôt live up to them.

Manuel Manuel,4,2024-05-20 10:18:00,"Positive: A great experience that you should definitely have if you are in Amsterdam. The free ferries take you directly to the observation tower every 10 minutes from Centraal train station. The view is magnificent, the staff is very friendly and you can relax on the roof with drinks and music on comfortable cushions. The elevator ride is also an experience thanks to the light show. All in all, really worth a visit. Negative: The entrance fees are hefty but still reasonable, in contrast to the extremely expensive prices at the rooftop bar. A 0.25l cola and a 0.5l beer cost ‚Ç¨15 WITHOUT a tip. The queue to get to the elevator is long and it hardly goes any further because everyone takes photos of them which you can then buy at the exit. This should be optional and regulated with a second row. We waited 25 minutes for a photo that we never wanted and didn't buy, like probably 95% of us before us.",German,0.5,positive

The swing itself doesn't last very long, but you have a 360¬∞ view from the terrace, which is definitely worth it.

I put the tickets I wanted to buy into the basket, I already had them at the checkout, I entered my bank card details, but the purchase didn't go through for some reason. I tried several times and it didn't work. I went to the location (A'dam lookout), where the cashier told me that their system was not working, so it was not possible to pay online or on site. Then my bank account manager informed me that my bank card was suspended, because bank card fraudsters controlled the A'DAM LOOKOUT website that night, where they obtained my bank card details and wanted to take my money. I couldn't use my bank card from that moment on. I do not blame the company A'DAM LOOKOUT, but a security protection on the website against fraudsters would be recommended. Others should not run into this, which I did too, so that bank card data is stolen by phishers.",Hungarian,-1.0,negative

We went to the roof terrace to go and do the swing, really good experience and was very quick for us to get on, pretty much walked straight on, I imagine if there was a queue it would move quite quickly

J√∂rg Reichmann,2,2025-05-10 17:35:00,"Another crowded hotspot in Amsterdam. We bought tickets on site. The lady was very stressed and probably didn't feel like it anymore. First we had to wait forever to get to the 1st floor and then another 45 minutes until we got to the elevator. The 10 second lift ride is quite expensive at ‚Ç¨18. Ultimately it is a viewing platform. The highlight: LEDs are incorporated into the elevator shaft and they light up alternately. There is a really great and interesting 360 degree view at the top. Another ‚Ç¨7.50 is charged for swinging, with long waiting times again. We refrained from doing this because there are more spectacular swings. Like everything in the tower, the BAR is very expensive. Coffee, Cola Zero 0.2 l, ginger ale 0.2 l and a mixed starter plate (4 mini spring rolls and 8 bitterballs) were charged at just under ‚Ç¨40. It's a special, nice place, but does everything always have to be so overpriced? There were still dishes lying around everywhere, you didn't know whether anyone was still sitting or not. At least the live music in the bar was super cool. Well, here is the topic of generating sales and profits as much as possible. Seen it once and then it's good.

Sam M,5,2025-05-09 15:27:00,"If you‚Äôre visiting Amsterdam and looking for a unique view of the city, A‚ÄôDAM Lookout is an absolute must. Located just across the IJ River (a quick free ferry ride from Central Station), this experience offers more than just a scenic view ‚Äî it‚Äôs part thrill, part architecture, and part atmosphere.

The observation deck gives you a 360-degree panoramic view of Amsterdam, and on a clear day, you can see everything from the historic city center to the modern buildings in the North. The glass walls and open-air areas give you the freedom to enjoy the view however you like ‚Äî take photos, grab a drink, or just soak in the skyline.

But the real adrenaline rush? That comes from ‚ÄúOver the Edge‚Äù, the giant swing that takes you over the edge of the rooftop ‚Äî literally. It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart, but it‚Äôs an unforgettable way to see the city, especially as your legs dangle high above the river. Even if you‚Äôre nervous, it‚Äôs over quickly and completely safe ‚Äî plus the staff are friendly and do a great job explaining everything.

Inside, the interactive exhibits give you a cool, tech-forward look at Amsterdam‚Äôs culture, history, and future. There‚Äôs also a bar and restaurant upstairs where you can grab a drink or bite with the view ‚Äî definitely try to time your visit around sunset if you can, it‚Äôs absolutely stunning.

The vibe at A‚ÄôDAM Lookout is fun, upbeat, and modern ‚Äî perfect for couples, families, or solo travelers. Whether you‚Äôre into photography, architecture, or just want a cool view with a bit of a thrill, this is one of the top attractions in the city.",English,1.0,positive

The VR (virtual reality) roller coaster ride was a little too intense for my taste and left me with a sinking feeling in my stomach afterwards. Then we had dinner in the restaurant with a great view and sunset and the food was really delicious. Be sure to try the new cheesecake desserts on the menu. Both really tasty.

The view from the swing and the roof is breathtaking! The A'DAM lookout tower has some excellent views. The place is kept-clean and the lifts etc are accessible, even if the swing is not. The magnifying periscopes are free to use and even blur household buildings, which is a nice feature. The lookout tower experience is free with the I AMsterdam program also.

Negatives:
The swing on the top is one-use and you get about 3-4 minutes. (Not 7 minutes as advertised). The entire process feels very capitalistic and targeted to getting every cent from you. Don't bother with the 'virtual tour', it's 1 minute long. 5/7 of the staff were extremely passive-aggressive. The photos are advertised as free, but they charge ‚Ç¨20 and watermark them.

Laura Grazia Spedalieri,5,2025-05-29 20:55:00,"Visiting the A‚ÄôDAM Lookout was one of the most exciting and evocative experiences of my trip to Amsterdam. Access is free with the City Card, a great advantage for those who want to experience something unique without spending a fortune. The 360¬∞ view of the city is simply breathtaking: from the canals to the rooftops, passing through the IJ and beyond, every corner is worth a look. But the real jewel in the crown is undoubtedly the highest swing in Europe, where you are literally suspended in the void above the city. It is a perfect mix of adrenaline, fun and beauty: an absolute must! The atmosphere is lively and engaging: forget the classic soft lounge music. Here there is DJ music at full volume, lights and sensory vibrations that make the experience even more immersive. You almost feel like you are at a party‚Ä¶ 100 meters high! The free photo shoot included in the entrance is also very interesting. In addition to the classic photos with customizable backgrounds and the Amsterdam skyline, there are also real photos taken while you are on the swing, in motion, in the midst of the emotion. An authentic and fun memory to take home, included in the price. To complete it all there is a spacious panoramic bar, with a private area from which to enjoy the view in a more peaceful way, perhaps with a drink in hand. Modern, well-kept and perfectly organized. In short: a complete experience, which combines landscape, adrenaline and entertainment in one place. The A'DAM Lookout is much more than a lookout: it is a must-see if you are in Amsterdam.

The attraction is very safe, accessible from 120 cm, and allows two or even three people to share this unforgettable moment per swing.

If you pay ‚Ç¨16, all you get is an elevator ride to the top floor and access to the rooftop, which offers a decent view ‚Äî but since the building is located on the edge of the city, you won‚Äôt see anything truly beautiful. It‚Äôs just a distant panoramic view of the city, which would be fine if the price were lower. At least you also get access to a restaurant ‚Äî with overpriced food and tons of dirty tables that no one cleans for over 30 minutes.

But if you decide to buy the full package including the VR rollercoaster and the rooftop swing ‚Äî well, that‚Äôs also underwhelming. The VR quality is extremely outdated: the video resolution is very low, and the objects in the video look like they‚Äôre from the early 2000s. The ride mechanism itself, which simulates a real rollercoaster experience, actually works quite well. Unfortunately, on top of the poor video quality, the VR headset I got was dirty ‚Äî it looked like someone had wiped greasy fingers across the center of the lenses. I asked a staff member to clean it, but it didn‚Äôt help. In the end, I could only see clearly on the edges of the screen.

As for the swing ‚Äî it‚Äôs okay, but I personally didn‚Äôt get much of an adrenaline rush, since even at its highest point, you‚Äôre not that far off the edge of the building. The swing ride itself lasts around 30 seconds, which is very short.

But the cherry on top? They film you during the experience and then generously offer to sell you a 30-second video and 5 photos for ‚Ç¨30 ‚Äî seriously?! So you pay ‚Ç¨30 for the full ticket and get nothing of real value, and then they basically spit in your face and ask for another ‚Ç¨30 for something that should have been included.

I don‚Äôt understand how this place has so many positive reviews. It simply doesn‚Äôt deserve them. If everything ‚Äî including the photos ‚Äî was part of the ticket, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs okay, though still not great. But in reality, it‚Äôs just outrageous greed.",English,-1.0,negative

We booked the Tower lookout, swing and the VR ride. The VR ride was just OK, doesn't last too long and it is a roller-coaster that takes you around the city of Amsterdam. It was a nice addition to the booking.
The view from the top is stunning. you can see all the famous places of Amsterdam whilst enjoying a cold beer. The prices at the bar 0 probably to be expected - are very expensive, however well worth it when you are enjoying the view. It was not too busy when we went as was out of season, however, I could imagine this being extremely busy in the summer. 
It was interesting watching the video on the towers history (located on top floor before the swing). 
They do have a restaurant, however, I think you may have to book and it did seem to be very expensive. 
The swing itself is amazing. The view was unreal and staff were very helpful. It only lasts around 3-4 mins though which was short enough, but again, to be expected.

If your'e in the area it's totally worth getting to the rooftop for the views of Amsterdam, but don't waste your money on any of their ""extras"".
I was excited for the VR experience they propagate so much, but not impressed. At all.
There were no people in the queue for the VR, yet I had to let the two staff members who were talking to eachother know that I'm standing there, looking at them, to get their attention and to do their job. The seat at my VR capsule was flat, uncomfortable and one of the armrests had been damaged and made my elbow hurt. Not to mention the VR experience being FAR from amazing, and it lasted around a minute. Not worth the money.
At the rooftop, we got on the swing which swings you above the skyline of Amsterdam, once again, lasted very short, not worth the money. They have a big ""no photos"" notice all around the attraction, to prevent you from taking your own pictures, of course, because they take them for you and very generously offer you to PURCHASE them at their website.

Besides the roof top lookout, you can also try the VR ride and the most importantly, the swing that located on roof top.  you are halfway swing out of the building surrounded by great view of Adamsterdam.

You should pick the perfect time to see sunset here.  Very relaxing",English,1.0,positive

jeep_girl_00,5,2024-06-30 02:00:00,"A'Dam Lookout was highly recommended by both locals and friends who visited before us, and we're so glad we checked it out! Getting there was a breeze‚Äîwe took the free ferry behind Centraal Station, and it was just a few minutes' walk to the Lookout.

We purchased the tower and swing tickets, hopped in line, and enjoyed the light show in the elevator on the way up. The first level is packed with amenities: Ma'Dam restaurant and bar, washrooms, tiny lockers, and stairs leading to the top. Plus, you get an enclosed 360-degree view!

The top level is where the magic happens: a bar, smoking area, raised platforms for unobstructed photos, the iconic A'Dam sign, lounge pillows, and the SWING! 

We had gorgeous weather, making the swing experience even better. Before swinging, you can stash your items in a basket in front of your swing. The swing felt incredibly safe, and we soared out over the edge about 25-26 times‚Äîpure exhilaration! Don't forget to keep the QR code for your swing photos.

After the swing, we enjoyed delicious burgers and fries at the restaurant. The little tubes of mayo are a genius idea! We were lucky to snag seating with a view in the Ma'Dam corner.

All in all, we're really happy we did this experience. Highly recommend for an unforgettable Amsterdam adventure!",English,1.0,positive
Sere,2,2024-06-25 02:00:00,"I had a day in Amsterdam and decided to check it out despite the very high price (‚Ç¨26 for going to the roof of the tower + doing a 1 minute experience on the swing) since I had read good reviews. Sadly, it's a tourist trap.

If you're looking to sit on the roof for the entire afternoon, then it might be worth it, as it's a nice enough environment, but if you're actually there for the view, there isn't much to see, as there is either a grate or glass and so you can't even take a good picture, and you pretty much see all there is to see in a couple of minutes.

The swing itself... It was going a bit too fast for my taste, so I didn't enjoy it as much. The staff was lovely (and the only reason why it's a 2 star review instead of 1 star), but the experience is really only good for Instagram, as they take some pictures of you.

The biggest rip-off is at the end: when you do the swing, they give you a piece of paper with a QR code. Before you leave, you scan it into a machine and you have the option to buy the photos: 3 printed photos for ‚Ç¨25 plus an additional ‚Ç¨5 if you also want to download the digital versions. The photos were cute so I bought them for ‚Ç¨25 (a HUGE amount for what they are), only to find out that... If you scan the QR code on your phone, you can actually download them for free! But oh no, they don't tell you this when you're there, which feels like a huge rip-off. I wouldn't recommend this at all!",English,0.0,neutral

A83,5,2024-05-28 02:00:00,As someone who doesn‚Äôt like heights I stupidly said yes to doing the swing once we got to the top we had quite a wait so definitely get there 15 minutes early if you are doing the swing. When it was our turn the instructor was super friendly and explained everything to make me feel better. I learnt that as long as I look outwards and not down then it was fine and I could enjoy the view! I would say that if you are going to come here and have a drink then use the downstairs bar and take the drinks up to the roof as they only had 4 options of drink on the roof and all of them I didn‚Äôt like so I went downstairs and got a martini for only ‚Ç¨6. The BR experience was alright and was good to do but it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmust do‚Äù whilst you are there,English,1.0,positive
Ben White,5,2024-05-27 02:00:00,"We were so lucky to be blessed with a sunny day when we visited A'DAM Lookout.
There's a very short free ferry ride which leave every 15 minutes I believe, which goes from Centraal Station. Make sure you get on the one that says Veerkade Noord.
There was very short queue to get in and there's a pleasant suprise in the elevator, so if you're scared of elevators this should help. You get a fridge magnet included in your ticket price, there's a restaurant inside as well as a viewing platform which is inside and toilets.
We also paid to go on the swing which is a definite, if you're looking for an adrenaline rush and want to soak up a gorgeous view on Amsterdam. At the top, they have oversized beang bags and a bar so perfect to chill with friends and get drunk.
Overall, would highly recommend whether you want to do the swing or not.",English,1.0,positive

KrazyKatlover,5,2024-05-22 02:00:00,"I booked here for my 50th birthday purely because I wanted to do something different other than just wander around‚Ä¶.and I‚Äôm so glad I did! 
Feeling hungover from the night before, we took a hassle free ferry over from Amsterdam Centraal and followed in the direction of the big tower! 
Barely any queues, we eased through with our QR codes and took a disco lift that took you up many floors in a blink of an eye! ( There is a green room set up on entry to have pictures took which are really well presented and are great memory keepsakes) 
And when we got to the very top‚Ä¶..WOW‚Ä¶..this was my very first visit to the Dam and what a focal point to see it all from. Views for miles and so many photos to take! 
I didn‚Äôt really know much to why this tower was here, but after watching videos and reading up, I see now this is the work of pure genius. Not only is it the best viewing platform to see the whole of  Amsterdam but it sports a hotel, a nightclub, a bar, an interactive games platform and a revolving restaurant‚Ä¶.it really ticks all boxes. 
With my entry that I pre booked weeks before online, I also added the ‚ÄúOver the Edge‚Äù swing experience‚Ä¶..I was hoping that my partner would be too jaded from the night before to go on it, but sadly not! I‚Äôm completely terrified of heights so cannot understand why I thought it would be a good thing to do??! But I did it, I nearly passed out on the damn thing through fear, but I‚Äôve kept every picture and video they recorded of us to prove I went on the highest swing in Europe‚Ä¶.even if it was the worst 2 mins of my life!!! 
So yes this is a must‚Ä¶..even if your eyes are closed through it!!! 
A well deserved birthday prosecco was needed in the Madam bar afterwords to calm my nerves and take in the wonder of Amsterdam. 
Following this I booked the VR  Rollercoaster experience which was great fun, an interactive ride through Amsterdam was different, exhilarating and I didn‚Äôt want it to end. 
There are ‚Äúinsta‚Äù photo opportunities galore in this place with a red horse and huge Adam sign to sit on right at the top, as well as the awesome views‚Ä¶.
We finished this off with a four course tasting lunch menu in the Moon revolving restaurant which was absolutely perfect in every way. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate my 50th with them memories forever locked in now. If you only have a few days in Amsterdam‚Ä¶.please pencil this in because you won‚Äôt be disappointed!",English,1.0,positive

We went around 1pm and it was pretty busy for the time but the staff run a smooth and efficient service so you get your turn pretty quickly. Staff also take pictures whilst you‚Äôre on the swing which you can purchase or download for free on to your phone via the ticket given to you. The viewpoint in general was nice and very relaxed atmosphere - there were lots of seating areas and you are able to purchase food/drink to enjoy on top. We had Iam city cards so the actual entry was free and we paid ‚Ç¨7.50 each for the swing which was great value, without the city card the entrance plus swing tickets add up to 25 euros or so each. 
Accessing Ad‚Äôam lookout was really straightforward - easy to get to central station via the tram or metro. Once you‚Äôre on the harbour there are regular ferries which you will need to board to go across to the other side of the harbour where Ad‚Äôam is located. The ferry is free and very regular.

prettyvale,4,2024-05-06 02:00:00,"It was the last day and we didn't know what to do... then it occurred to us that we could take a swing ride at 100 meters above sea level, so we went to the central station and followed the signs for FERRY.
Once at the boarding point, take the F3 which will take you to the other side of the river in 5 minutes for free.

From there, the swing is immediately visible.
Entrance isn't cheap, but we've never had an experience like this before, so we went in

Entrance fee to go to the rooftop is ‚Ç¨18.50 each. Here you can see the view or have something at the bar.
Additional cost for swing ‚Ç¨7.50 each.
The tour lasts 1 minute and at the end we send you a link with photos that you can download for free. If you want them printed, there is an additional cost to pay.

One of the city's most popular attractions, it offers stunning views of Amsterdam and its surroundings. From the top of the tower, we enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of the city, including the famous canals, the rooftops of historic houses and iconic landmarks such as the Magere Brug Tower and the Anne Frank House and Central Station of course.
Then the ""Over the Edge"" swing, which hangs 100 meters high on the side of the tower, (the highest in Europe, they say) provides a unique adrenaline experience.
Don't forget the VR experience, the closest thing to a real roller coaster.
There is also a bar and restaurant on site where we can relax and enjoy a drink or a meal whilst admiring the scenery.
